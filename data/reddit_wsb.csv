Blue Origin and Space X take feud to space

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has complained to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), asking to limit the number of launches Elon Musk‚Äôs Space X can conduct in Florida, reigniting the billionaire feud, Business Insider reported.

Blue Origin has asked the FAA to put a cap on SpaceX's Ss-SH, citing several concerns, particularly for the local environment, and arguing that ""Ss-SH operations are expected to have a greater environmental impact than any other launch system currently operating"" nearby.

"Is Palantir just a ""glorified"" consulting company?",265,1dtibz6,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtibz6/is_palantir_just_a_glorified_consulting_company/,133,"Like a lot of you, I was bullish on Palantir (PLTR) for a long time. But after spending more time looking into it, I'm starting to feel less optimistic. Here's what feels off to me:

* I've spent a lot of time with data science and AI, but I rarely see Palantir products in the wild. Snowflake's products, for comparison, are pretty ubiquitous for data engineering.
* The AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) looks great on paper, but it'll take a lot of resources to implement it. Just picture trying to integrate all the production and logistics details of even a small-sized company‚Äîit‚Äôs a huge task that requires a lot of Palantir experts and thus money.
* This brings me to the next thing: Palantir was often called a ""glorified"" IT consulting company, not a real software company. From what I know, Palantir doesn't have its own foundational AI model. AIP is ""just"" a platform for implementing models like GPT-4 and mirroring a company's internal networks. Such customized software solutions must be a huge effort to create and maintain. But what's the moat here? That doesn't mean that the resulting software is bad, but how does this scale? To me, this sounds like a consulting business...
* Palantir has a great reputation thanks to its government contracts. But this mainly comes from the days when it was hard for government organizations to find good programmers - perfect conditions for an IT consulting company. 
* Palantir's bulls often say that the company's most advanced technology is top secret, which makes it hard to see how they're ahead of the game. If these cutting-edge technologies are only for the military and intelligence, then Palantir is basically a defense contractor, which also doesn‚Äôt justify the current valuation.

This is critical where privacy is a concern (e.g. healthcare, defense) but you want/need people to analyze data without having it go out in the wild. And once you build the database, you essentially service and support it so long as it‚Äôs active so it‚Äôs a recurring revenue generator.\n\nYes, you could in theory go ahead and do this from scratch but the months/years it will take you to get up to speed and do all the QC testing will put you behind competitors.\n\nIt‚Äôs got more in common with Veeva than any typical AI company, but has a different customer base.', 'Palantir is an end to end platform that has tons of use cases across different industries.

Palantir is the softaware being chosen to run a variety of different program initiatives in the military.\n\nAIP is just an integration which allows ai chatbots to be used with the software that Palantir already has. This lets people use ChatGPT or other chat bots as an interface to the companies data which is all already stored and organized in Palantir. Just imagine asking a chatbot trained on your companies data how to solve a problem, and it offers actual solutions that might work.\xa0\n\nPalantir doesn‚Äôt need its own ai chat bot because that by itself isn‚Äôt that useful to a company.

NVDA H20 Demand Stronger Than Expected - Morgan Stanley,129,1dtl0z2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtl0z2/nvda_h20_demand_stronger_than_expected_morgan/,52,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-h20-demand-stronger-than-expected-morgan-stanley-3505205

Main point of the article:

_Per Morgan Stanley‚Äôs note, major hyperscalers in China, while complying with export control regulations, are purchasing NVIDIA‚Äôs H20 chips for AI computing needs. Although smaller AI data center vendors in China can offer the H100 GPU for rental, the larger hyperscalers are opting to buy the H20, adhering to the regulatory requirements.
Based on their field trip takeaways, analysts said the single-chip performance of the H20 is only 15% that of the H100. Furthermore, when comparing ""Performance Density"" based on the Float 16 data type, the H20's single chip performance is only 3% of that of the H100.
‚ÄúHowever, by connecting a cluster of H20 GPUs, performance can reach 50% of that of the H100, thanks to higher networking bandwidth and the HBM density of H20,‚Äù analysts pointed out. ‚ÄúAnd hence it is possible the H20 chip price could also be 50% of H100.‚Äù_

Jensen keeps telling y‚Äôall the world isn‚Äôt waiting on shit ‚Äî the AI race is on now, and there‚Äôs no stopping it in the near future. Does that guarantee NVDA will dominate like this for the next decade? I don‚Äôt fucking know, I work at Wendy‚Äôs.

But when even your biggest political foe cannot keep its hands off nvda chips, may be some of you chubby berrs should give it a rest too.

Positions: leaps.

Biggest losses:

* Bought \~$300k shares of SAVE to sell covered calls literally¬†**minutes**¬†before the merger was blocked. Luckily I was able to make \~$50k on the covered calls, but ultimately I took my losses (about -$200k) and put the remainder in GOOG calls (see below)
* My next 3 largest losses were all in GOOG puts trying to time the ""top"" of after a run up

Biggest wins:

* During the initial Bard snafu that resulted in a large drop in GOOG, I sold the remainder of my SAVE shares (about $100k worth) and put them into weekly GOOG calls. After a 4 day run up, I sold for \~$200k profit.
* Made \~$250k on META puts on Kashkari day

More recently, I've been making smaller plays with ITM calls/puts about 7-10 days out and aiming for 30-40% gains (or small losses). Some tips and reflections after 6 months:

* I don't play 0DTE or 1DTE options, I've had a medium amount of luck here, but they are way too high stress
* I focus mostly on large cap tech stocks and usually purchase ITM calls/puts after run ups/sells off, aiming for a 3rd/4th red or green day in a row, and then a targeting a point in the day where there's \~2%+ move in the same direction
* I'm taking about 2 months off from trading because work is getting busy again and I'm taking a few weeks off to travel",2024-07-02 15:47:32,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 5 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Good job, Why still have a normal job?', 'Living the dream man.

"Lithium stocks are cold, and they are a buy",18,1dtpmnt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtpmnt/lithium_stocks_are_cold_and_they_are_a_buy/,25,"Hello everyone, bit of a raw opinion piece here‚Ä¶

**Just to name a few‚Ä¶ Albemarle, Pilbara Minerals Limited, Liontown Resources, Iluka Resources, Lynas Rare Earths.
(Some Lithium and some rare earths)**
Full disclosure, I own all of these except Albemarle.


These companies have dropped 30, 40, 50 and 70+% from 2022-3 highs.

Have a look at Liontown resources. Albemarle was prepared to pay 6.6B for it. Billionaire Gina Rhineheart brought up a 20% stake @ 2.9 to block the deal. Now the price is @ 1 less than a year later.
So a multi billion dollar company believed in Liontown resources and a seasoned mining mogul does too.

Additionally, many of these companies have federal financial support and subsidies.

**The downstream products‚Ä¶**

What we just experienced was the first wave of EV purchases - the early adopters. Those that aren‚Äôt apprehensive about the charging infrastructure. Enthusiasts. And generally rich people that can afford a new Tesla. The 5%.

This is what caused the recent lithium price surge.

But gradually, EVs are becoming more affordable. Particularly thanks to China. BYD specifically has grown into one of the largest automakers offering products for the middle class.
This is the next 50-70% where their next car will PHEV or EV. I don‚Äôt know when this will happen exactly.. I suspect around 2026/7 we will see the demand for PHEVs in particular become the new normal (over the regular combustion engines).

So if the early adopters of EVs caused the lithium price to rocket. What will happen when it becomes mainstream?

**So what are the risks?**

1. There‚Äôs a chronic oversupply. 
Too many mines are being built, the market is being flooded with lithium. Evidently when the price collapsed too low, the smaller miner core lithium halted operations. It literally cost more money to mine it, than what it received selling.

2. Battery manufacturers are stockpiling whilst prices are low. And are currently still working through these stockpiles. Who knows when demand grows notably.

3. Lithium and its lightweight properties is only applicable to BEVs. Sodium (very abundant) can be used as an alternative battery. Potentially for industrial and residential use. It is cheaper than lithium but has about half the energy density to its weight.
Also, for your general info.. Lithium by weight only contributes about 15% of a batteries total mass.

4. These new mines and processing plants‚Ä¶ might just not work. I‚Äôm an engineer. And honestly, sometimes things turn into white elephants. Or the owner and operator spends 5 years after it‚Äôs designed and constructed, tinkering with the equipment and process to actually get it working. Don‚Äôt trust the company announcements. It‚Äôs in their interests to keep market sentiment positive and the share price high.

5. Ultimately you‚Äôre at the mercy of the commodity price. They are unpredictable and don‚Äôt need a recession to tumble.



Anyways, I still have much more I could share about this. But I‚Äôm trying to keep it tight. My goal is to put lithium (and rare earths) on the radar for this community.

But in the end its all just noise. Arguably the greatest investor of our time warren buffet used a buy and hold good companies strategy. Even if you hate elon musk the reality is tesla is a good company.  The question is do you believe in their vision. 

I personally think tesla is investing for a future economy where they are primary disruptors. And I wouldn't be surprised if they are the most valuable company in the world by 2030. 

This is because as many of you may not fully appreciate, tesla has a moat. They own the full ecosystem of technology. They have the charging infrastructure, the manufacturing capacity to build robotaxis/humanoid robots, energy storage,  software development, the data, and even lithium production. The fact that tesla owns the full stack of technology gives them a competitive advantage. The robotaxi and humanoid robot industries are going to be the key pillars of the 21st century industrial revolution ushering in a productivity and profit boom.

SPACE The New Frontier RKLB LUNR 10% Gain,9,1dtpadt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtpadt/space_the_new_frontier_rklb_lunr_10_gain/,17,"
*üöÄ Rocket Lab (RKLB) & Intuitive Machines (LUNR): Why I'm Bullish üöÄ**

**Rocket Lab (RKLB)**:  
I'm incredibly bullish on RKLB. They've been strategically acquiring satellite manufacturing companies over the past few years, and these moves have already paid off in new revenue streams. After Virgin Galactic's fall, Rocket Lab bought their manufacturing facilities at a staggering 90% discount. Now, they're a space prime that offers end-to-end services: building, launching, and operating satellites. 

- **Revenue Breakdown**: Launches are now only a third of their revenue, a proportion that might change with Neutron's upcoming launches but not drastically. 
- **Products**: They manufacture space-based solar panels, microchips, satellite thrusters, communication lasers, and more. One of the few fully vertically integrated space companies globally.

**Government Contracts**:  
Check out the [Space Development Agency](https://open.substack.com/pub/caseclosed/p/stars-stripes-and-satellites?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=39s0pp). With billions in funding every year into the 2030s, RKLB has already secured $500M and continues to land new contracts frequently.

**Commercial Contracts**:  
There are 389 [mega constellations](https://www.newspace.im/) in development. Satellites in LEO have a lifespan of about 5 years, requiring constant replacements. This massive, growing market is not going away.

**Future Plans**:  
Rocket Lab plans to build and launch their own megaconstellations, offering services directly to businesses on Earth. Whether it's earth observation or communication, Rocket Lab can pivot and capitalize on these profitable opportunities.

**Financials**:  
They have a backlog of about $2B in orders today, expected to double by 2025. Their market cap is just over $2B, making them an insane bargain right now. If you can handle the development delays with Neutron, there's potential for a 10x return, which would still be just a fraction of SpaceX's market cap.

**Positions**: 7.5k shares at an average price of $4.50. Acquiring more.


*Intuitive Machines (LUNR)**:  
While the focus here is on RKLB, LUNR also presents a compelling opportunity in the space sector. Their expertise in lunar and space technologies complements Rocket Lab's capabilities, making them another exciting company to venture into.

Visa moon theory in light of recent SC rulings,6,1dtqhqx,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtqhqx/visa_moon_theory_in_light_of_recent_sc_rulings/,9,"So, two related SC rulings that play into this

1) corner post

2) chevron 

There‚Äôs plenty of room for nuance and I‚Äôve got to look into it much, much more, but, here‚Äôs my general take aways

1) swipe fee companies can create as many bullshit companies as they want to challenge regulations in perpetuity 

2) swipe fee companies can jack rates indiscriminately with no regard for regulations outside the letter of the law.

While the chevron ruling includes a caveat that it‚Äôs not retroactively ‚Äúundoing‚Äù everything established, they make it clear that those precedents are not set in stone either. They literally are not law. Therefore, between the two cases, swipe fee companies should be able to generate companies to challenge regulations at will, forever, and the regulations they challenge, outside that which is outlined in the underlying law, essentially have no authority. Obviously, the SC is gonna do what it wants regardless of hypocrisy and/or technicality, but if there isn‚Äôt a hard on for swipe fee companies I think in time this could mean the cuffs just got reallll loose

Let this be a lesson to every regard that strikes it rich. Never Fomo in again and get angry when making investment decisions, because you will get your bootywhole pummeled without lube and it will be brutal

I think what makes this post 10x more brutal is that I'm 28 so this is basically my life savings lol

I was planning on taking a chick out to vacay and buying a property but I guess I'll do that in the next 3 years or so lol

THE STORY

The reason why I didn't buy calls again after the stellar earnings report is because after having traded Nvidia for several months, I knew what kind of monster I was dealing with. High sensitivity to federal reserve rate announcements, the war in Gaza, tech shows etc. even when I put a stop loss I'd wake up and see it sell and blow past the stop loss I put it at so if I sell early I lose if I don't sell I lose it was all fucked lol

So I was like ok let's avoid the stress of waking up and seeing me getting fucked because of a bad position or for it to drop back down to the low thousands I'll just stay out for a bit

Little did I know, this fucking company would go up 40% over the span of 2 months with only a 20% increase in guidance. How does that even remotely make sense

But it's clear that stock markets have long abandoned rational movement patterns. It should have stopped around 1150 or 1200 and corrected down to 1100 or something but nah that Bch kept going up

And it just pissed me off so much, I could've full ported again and had half a million in the bank and never had to deal with this shit again, but I opted out and opted back in at the worst possible time and in the worst way possible lmao

Knowing my luck this shits gonna trade sideways for the rest of July and then start the ascent on August so I'll buy august calls when they're a little cheaper and do another full port on this earnings. After that I'll probably ride the gains for a week and never touch this shit again lol

Either that or lose every penny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Vistra Corp $VST and Constallation Energy,10,1dtikpw,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtikpw/vistra_corp_vst_and_constallation_energy/,7,"Hi Everyone,

(my position: 32 option contracts / 3200 calls, strike 92.5 expiration sept20, 2024 to be rolled over if stock climbs up in VST only). 

  
I would like to share my recent research on Vistra Corp, I became interested in this stock after reading about other sectors being affected by A.I. and Semi and naturally the most adjecent sector is the energy sector. In other words, tech companies require stable, high amount of carbon-free energy. 

  
Vistra Corp already doubled over last couple of months but there is more room to go. Constallation Energy is in a similar boat. Other companies that are caught up in this trend: NRG and Talen. What divides the winners from the losers, if the amount of overcapacity they can sell at a premium to these power hungry tech firms.

Bullish arguments

- tech companies scour the country looking for electricity supplies and have zeroed in on nuclear-power plants

- AWS close to closing a deal with Constallation Energy (another big buy) 

- The surging demand puts more strain on already overstrained power grid in the U.S. These new kinds of electricity users come from AI, manufacturing and transparations. 

- Nuclear-powered data centers would match the grid's highest reliability workhorse with a wealthy customer that wants 24-7 carbon free power. Likely speeding the addtition of data centers needed in the Global AI race. In other words, its a private wealth management divison of these electric companies.

- Most companies would be dividing resources, between retail and wholesale, but Vistra Corp has a different plan.

- Vistra is growning non-organically through M&A increasing their nucleair power capacity with Energy Harbor acquisition. 

VISTRA PROPOSITION

There is interest in a so called new type of structure called behind-the-meter deals, in which a large customer receives power directly from a plant. Shares of¬†VST, the largest competitive power generator in the U.S., have more than doubled this year. The company has been in talks for behind-the-meter deals at both nuclear and gas plants.

‚ÄúIn this case, the customer has come to us and come to many in the industry and said ‚ÄòI need as much power as you can make available,‚Äô‚Äù said Vistra Chief Executive¬†Jim Burke.

  
CONSTELLATION ENERGY

Constellation Energy, which owns 14 U.S. nuclear-power plants and produces more than a fifth of the nation‚Äôs nuclear power, has seen its shares rise more than 70% this year.Constellation‚Äôs president and CEO,¬†Joseph Dominguez, said there are still many places, including a swath from Pennsylvania to Illinois, with an oversupply of power. That leaves room for data centers, he said. Contracts with data centers willing to pay a premium would cover the cost of re-licensing, he said, extending plant life another 20 years and supporting investments that could boost nuclear-power output. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have those things, we‚Äôre going to lose the nukes again,‚Äù Dominguez said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to go back to where we were.‚Äù

Bearish arguments

  
- politicians in the specific districts push back because the large corporations are getting more favourable deals than consumers and free-ride of the energy transition that citizens helped pay for. 

- The power grid is already at capacity especially during unfavourable weather conditions in Texas for example. 

- Stocks are already up, even though the are receiving more buy recommendations.

Resist the urge to short healthcare stocks as they print new ATHs this year,23,1dtba91,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtba91/resist_the_urge_to_short_healthcare_stocks_as/,35,"People will hate buy puts on LLY/NVO/HIMS and other pharma shit bc of the ‚Äúit‚Äôs up so much already, it‚Äôs due for a pullback or reduced earnings from new competition, tech level valuations for pharma companies isn‚Äôt reasonable‚Äù trap. 

Especially as LLY becomes the first trillion dollar healthcare company owing to their GLP1 and other longevity breakthroughs (and kicks off market wide fomo). 

They‚Äôll ‚Äúaverage‚Äù into puts and wake up to new ATHs. It‚Äôll drive them insane. If you don‚Äôt believe me, ask the guy here who‚Äôs been shorting LLY since 400$ and seetheposting begging people to buy puts every other week. 

I think what bers get wrong is that healthcare isn‚Äôt like electronics or utilities or other goods (where you anticipate spending/costs/margins/earnings growth hitting a wall from all the advancements). 

On the contrary, as we inch towards a world that‚Äôs more and more automated (despite what all the doomers calling for the end of the world want to believe), healthcare is the only sector that will justify and see more spending imo. 

If spared from the usual mundane burdens of life (owing to increased efficiency across the economy), Wouldn‚Äôt you spend more of your income and time on healthcare? Whether surface level stuff like fixing baldness (to signal status in a world where those games are inescapable) or serious stuff like addiction or obesity which leads to overall well being? 

I personally (even if a bit naive) am hopeful for an optimistic future where all of us spend a larger % of our income ‚Äîon everything from glp1, reversible gene therapy, early prevention solutions unique to your DNA profile‚Äî in an attempt to extend our lifetime, if only because everything else in life has become much more cheaper/accessible.

Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year‚Äôs end,1017,1dshht2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dshht2/nvidia_just_getting_started_stock_heading_to_150/,512,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they‚Äôve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don‚Äôt settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia‚Äôs stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn‚Äôt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn‚Äôt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia‚Äôs place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn‚Äôt happened and Nvidia‚Äôs only gotten stronger.

That‚Äôs not to say over time Nvidia won‚Äôt lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it‚Äôs not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don‚Äôt think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

HIMS DD,0,1dtkghm,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dtkghm/hims_dd/,11,"### DD: Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (HIMS)

### 1. **Executive Summary**
- **Company Name:** Hims & Hers Health, Inc.
- **Ticker Symbol:** HIMS
- **Current Price:** $21.42 (as of latest trading)
- **Target Price:** $30+
- **Investment Horizon:** Medium-term (1-2 years)
- **Key Thesis Points:**
  - Expansion into the high-demand GLP-1 drugs market.
  - Significant pricing advantage with new weight-loss offerings.
  - Strong revenue growth forecast driven by the increased demand for GLP-1 drugs and other health products.

### 2. **Company Overview**
- **Business Description:** Hims & Hers Health, Inc. is a telehealth company offering a range of wellness and health products, including sexual health, skincare, mental health, and recently, weight-loss solutions. The company is known for its direct-to-consumer model that simplifies access to health products.
- **History and Background:** Founded in 2017, Hims & Hers quickly expanded its product offerings and market reach. It leverages a telehealth platform to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions.
- **Management Team:** 
  - **Andrew Dudum:** CEO and co-founder, experienced in consumer technology and entrepreneurship.
  - **Hilary Coles:** Co-founder and VP of Product, driving product development and customer experience.

### 3. **Industry Analysis**
- **Industry Overview:** The telehealth industry is growing rapidly due to increased adoption of digital health solutions and the convenience of remote healthcare services.
- **Market Trends:** Key trends include rising consumer acceptance of telehealth, increased focus on preventive care, and the growing demand for weight-loss medications.
- **Competitive Landscape:** Major competitors include Teladoc Health, Amwell, and Ro. Hims & Hers differentiates itself through aggressive pricing, a broad product portfolio, and a direct-to-consumer approach.
- **Regulatory Environment:** Favorable trends support telehealth expansion, but the company faces scrutiny regarding its compounded drug offerings, particularly in weight-loss treatments.

### 4. **Product Offering**
- **New Product Launch:** Hims & Hers Health Inc. is launching $199 weight-loss shots that are significantly cheaper than Novo Nordisk‚Äôs Wegovy, which costs approximately $1,350 per month without insurance, and Eli Lilly‚Äôs Zepbound.
- **Active Ingredient:** The weight-loss treatment offered by Hims & Hers contains the same active ingredient as Wegovy, positioning it as a cost-effective alternative.

### 5. **Market and Competition**
- **High Demand and Shortages:** Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound are experiencing significant shortages due to high demand. Both companies are expanding their manufacturing capacity but currently, the availability of these weight-loss injections in the U.S. is limited.
- **Compounded Drug Market:** Hims & Hers is entering the compounded GLP-1 market, which has attracted attention due to the significant demand for weight-loss drugs. However, this market also faces scrutiny and regulatory challenges, especially concerning the safety and quality of compounded drugs.
- **Competitive Advantage:** The $199 per month price for the weight-loss shots represents an 85% discount compared to Wegovy. This aggressive pricing strategy is aimed at capturing market share by providing an affordable alternative to high-cost branded weight-loss medications.

### 6. **Sales and Growth**
- **Sales Performance:** Hims & Hers has nearly reached $1 billion in sales within a few years by making generic versions of popular drugs accessible and affordable. The company is now applying this successful strategy to the weight-loss market.
- **Revenue Growth:** The company reported a 55.65% increase in revenue over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, highlighting rapid expansion in its telehealth services.
- **Recent Stock Performance:** Hims & Hers Health has shown a substantial increase in stock price, with a 26.88% return over the last week, 47.81% over the last month, and 85.82% over the last three months. This strong short-term performance reflects investor confidence and market momentum.

### 7. **Supply and Manufacturing**
- **Compounding Pharmacies:** The weight-loss shots are supplied by BPI. This approach allows Hims & Hers to provide the treatment at a lower cost, although it may also attract regulatory scrutiny.
- **Supplier Issues:** A short-seller report criticized BPI, the supplier of Hims' GLP-1 knockoffs, due to its association with Belcher Pharmaceuticals. In 2020, two Belcher executives were convicted of medical fraud, raising concerns about the supplier's credibility.
- **Company Response:** Hims & Hers responded to recent speculation on the risks of its compounded GLP-1 product and its manufacturer by reiterating its commitment to safety, emphasizing their dedication to going above and beyond regulatory requirements.

### 8. **Financial Analysis**
- **Revenue Analysis:** Hims & Hers reported strong revenue growth with a 55.65% increase over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. The weight-loss segment is expected to drive further significant growth.
- **Profitability:** The company‚Äôs gross profit margin is healthy at 82.41%, though it currently operates at a slight loss with an operating income margin of -0.54%.
- **Cost Structure:** Major costs include marketing, product development, and customer acquisition. The company‚Äôs focus on operational efficiency supports sustainable growth.
- **Balance Sheet Strength:** Hims & Hers has a strong cash position, ensuring liquidity for growth initiatives and operational stability.
- **Cash Flow Analysis:** Negative operating cash flow due to high investment in growth, but expected to improve with increased revenue from new product lines.

### 9. **Investment Risks**
- **Market Risks:** Volatility in the stock market and macroeconomic conditions could impact investor sentiment and stock performance.
- **Operational Risks:** Execution risk in scaling the new GLP-1 product line and maintaining supply chain stability.
- **Financial Risks:** Continued operating losses and cash burn could pose financial risks if not managed effectively.
- **Regulatory Risks:** Potential regulatory changes and scrutiny over compounded drugs and telehealth practices could impact operations.
- **Other Risks:** Competition from established players and legal liabilities related to the safety and efficacy of compounded drugs.

### 10. **Catalysts**
- **Upcoming Events:** Quarterly earnings reports, particularly the Q2 earnings on August 5, and updates on GLP-1 product performance.
- **Strategic Initiatives:** Expansion of product offerings and entry into new markets.
- **Market Conditions:** Continued high demand for telehealth services and weight-loss solutions.

### 11. **Recent Events**
- **Stock Decline:** Shares of Hims & Hers fell 12% on Thursday morning, following a 6.9% decline on Wednesday. The stock had previously gained 150% this year, but recent scrutiny over their weight loss business has led to significant volatility.
- **Scrutiny and Short-Seller Report:** A short-seller report by Hunterbrook Media accused Hims & Hers of giving weight-loss prescriptions without proper doctor supervision and highlighted potential legal liabilities if the GLP-1 knockoffs prove unsafe, ineffective, or infringe on Big Pharma patents.
- **Insider Transactions:** Some Hims & Hers executives, including the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, sold more than 1.7 million shares, realizing $26.4 million since announcing the GLP-1 knockoffs on May 20. Conversely, Christopher D. Payne, a director at Hims & Hers, purchased 110,000 shares at an average price of $17.7433, amounting to a total investment of approximately $1.95 million, signaling confidence in the company‚Äôs future prospects.

Plan to buy more on the next dip, and looking at Jan 25 35cs 


Full disclosure: ChatGPT 4o helped me draft this. I asked it to help summarize recent news and events and investment theses on HIMS and to put those into an investment thesis structure. I did not do any valuation analysis to arrive at 30 per share price target. I picked that number based on gut feel alone. The market oppportunity is huge, and HIMS is well positioned to capture share early and sustainably. I aim to buy more calls on this on the next dip. I think this will be a volatile ride. If I don't get another chance to buy low, I will just ride my existing positions. Big upcoming date is Aug 5th earnings.

So we have 160k using GLP‚Äôs via HIMS at 1.99 a month. 

1.99 X 12 X 160000 = 380MM 

This does not factor in new subscribers coming into HIMS and signing up for GLP‚Äôs
( who knows what that number might be ) 

This also does not factor in new subscribers choosing other products like dick pills or hair loss and seeing HIMS as a one stop shop for bone dogs, losing some weight and getting some hair - 

Currently HIMS forecasted to do about 1.2BB for 2024 and be in the black a couple hundred million 

If they come out and say the growth rate is even at this level how does this stock not go parabolic ? Do we really think at that point HIMS continues to trade at 3x sales give or take ?

There are over 100MM people who are obese in the USA ( that‚Äôs probably on the light side ) 

So we are basically asking for less than .2% of 1% of obese people in the USA to sign up for a product that is 80% cheaper than WEGOVY  ? 

I believe we are going to see some seriously explosive numbers that take this stock parabolic.  This name is mispriced for maybe the CEO and his comments , that short report, people saying there is no Moat and all that. 

But when you blow your numbers out and show that type of bottom line growth that all gets thrown out 

This is my favorite 2nd half of year stock play 
DYOR and Happy 4th !!

$RL Ralph Lauren EZ Dip Buy Off Disastrous NKE Earnings,22,1dszc83,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dszc83/rl_ralph_lauren_ez_dip_buy_off_disastrous_nke/,38,"Hello Degens, I understand most of you buy your clothes from Supreme, Walmart, and Goodwill but I come to you with a fashion DD for a brand with strong momentum in an increasingly fraught segment of consumer discretionary luxury fashion. The stock market regularly fucks up on consumer trends that are staring them in the face because fund managers are old ass white dudes who could care less about what Zoomers are wearing. This market inefficiency is easily exploited if you just walk around college campuses and big cities and pay attention. This is why I've made racks off Abercrombie & Fitch and Crocs while Wall Street and you basement dwellers could only scratch your heads as to why Tik Tok Americans are buying this crap.

I come to you with this next fashion trade: a quintessential American brand focused on old WASPy aesthetics and aspirational wealth made available to the average consumer. For a long time, RL was languishing as the only people buying their gaudy sportwear were software engineers and sysadmins who wear too much cologne. Finally, this brand has leaned into its classic and refined designs and is appealing to a new base of consumers who are conscious of fashion brands ripping them off with poor quality design and materials. Zoomers grow tired of their Shein hauls lasting 4-5 wears before falling apart and are now seeking quality. For this they turn to RL. [The Polo Bear](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_real_lin_shady/video/7337744810003975466?q=polo%20bear&t=1719855313784) and [American Flag](https://www.tiktok.com/@lindigoff/video/7247314494374890794?q=ralph%20lauren%20flag&t=1719855347065) sweaters have taken off in recent quarters, and their newly launched [Olympics merch](https://www.ralphlauren.com/women-clothing-sweaters/team-usa-graphic-cotton-sweater/0077505337.html?utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&utm_source=CSE&utm_medium=GooglePLA__21396036850_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aPScu0NhB1xCuOjCCJRfBT1kh_GxKqOrM3gELc3rwJ1dELvEbSYo9hoCZqMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) will continue propelling the brand forward. Many have been wrong about this stock in the past, [including this guy who yolo'd earnings puts that expired OTM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/), and I'm going to clear the confusion about this stock's recent momentum and place within larger fashion trends in America and worldwide.

# Why üåàüêª Are Wrong

Following Nike's disastrous earnings RL has continued a downward trend from ATH finding support at \~$170. Many assume that RL trades in the same group as companies like NKE and LULU, these are all luxury fashion brands of course, but RL is positioned differently. Athleisure is dead. If you walk around big cities like New York, regardless of time of day, fewer women are wearing the full LULU yoga set. The market for athleisure is saturated and being disrupted by cheap brands like Alo and Shein. Another trend fund managers fail to understand is Return to Office Fashion. You have an entire generation of young women who have never had a real job - and if they did it was a remote internship during the scamdemic - now asking on Tik Tok: ""How do I dress for the office""? [Ralph is a favorite brand](https://www.tiktok.com/@sx.ash/video/7324422099257347360?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7340732515428959790) for these [office girlies](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrsinkeduk/video/7314567769750523168?q=Ralph%20Lauren%20office&t=1719855177692) still figuring out what they're to be wearing. NKE and LULU make fund managers think that the American consumer is faltering, but this is not the case. They are simply terrible at managing trends. Look at Nike's product offerings. The [Adidas Samba](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fsamba-og-shoes%2FB75806.html&psig=AOvVaw0q5eapOvTD7lqAqoakYuB-&ust=1719941639846000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCOD42YSwhocDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) is the hottest sneaker right now for young men and women, coming off of the dominance of New Balance's suede casual sneakers. Nike makes only 1 or 2 sneakers ([Killshot](https://www.nike.com/t/killshot-2-womens-shoes-3z3Nnb/FZ5630-100) and Cortez) that have this classic casual, white leather look that consumers are looking for. Instead they focus only on athleisure and workout segments rather than fashion.

# Consumer Trends

In fashion, all of these mid level mall brands are trying to reposition themselves as ""luxury"" for the simple reason that they can charge more for each garment. However, many are doing this wrong. They are selling the same plastic crap for higher prices with more marketing. This has not been working great for Zara, Uniqlo, H&M, and others. This has worked out very well for Abercrombie & Fitch, Wall Street's current fashion darling, A&F has pivoted to selling clothes that are on trend with minimal branding and a commitment to quality. [A $50 shirt from A&F](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/long-sleeve-rugby-polo-53491348?seq=01&source=googleshopping&cmp=PLA:EVG:20:A:D:US:X:GGL:X:SHOP:X:X:X:X:x:A%26F+Adults_Google_Shopping_PLA_US_Tops_All+products_PRODUCT_GROUP&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aKoAbCRC5Ox_imUloA2HQ9JoIj4d8l92rJcS5INAYK3sD6vmshmrZxoCpo0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) uses high quality cotton that you can feel will last while Uniqlo keeps trying to market its $50 polyester shirts as ""office tech wear"" or some crap. RL is uniquely positioned with its brand placement historically to offer high quality items for high prices, and the consumer knows these garments will last for years. In addition, these looks are ""classic Americana"" and won't go out of style as quickly as these [Shein microtrends](https://www.tiktok.com/@catyaps/video/7353318659533622570?q=microtrends&t=1719855637194). The consumer has more confidence buying an RL garment that they are getting their money's worth for a quality garment.

I mentioned that walking around New York City you do not see athleisure, but you do see RL's biggest sellers everywhere. Gay guys love the Polo Bear: wearing it on sweaters and tshirts. Women love the American Flag sweater as an ""Old Money Fashion"" statement piece. I frequently see dupes from[ Shein or other Chinese crap](https://us.shein.com/American-Flag-Pattern-Drop-Shoulder-Sweater-p-21875906-cat-1734.html) companies of the American Flag sweater. This is probably bearish, but imitation is the highest form of flattery I guess? The trend is growing and has staying power if other companies want to swoop in.

Off the backs of these trendy items, RL has recently launched its Olympics Team USA collection which incorporates many designs from the brand's classic Americana past. This is already generating [social media buzz](https://x.com/fetacheesepls/status/1807467583035089004), and as we approach the Olympics this will create brand momentum. The opening ceremony and the team's clothing will likely generate additional buzz. We are 25 days out from the Olympics, this should be a great window to build a short term trade with the stock currently at support.

# Fundamentals

For a quick look at fundamentals, let's do a Peer comparison:

|Ticker|PE|TEV/EBIDTA|Debt/EBITDA|Gross Margin PCT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LULU|24.0|11.9|0.5|58.3%|
|NKE|20.2|14.0|1.5|44.6%|
|LEVI|53.6|8.2|2.0|58.0%|
|ANF|22.2|8.1|0.9|64.1%|
|**RL**|**18.0**|**7.2**|**1.6**|**66.8%**|

As we can see, RL is a leader among its peers in margin while trading at a discount relative to some of the biggest players in the space. RL carries some higher debt levels, but for a brand with this kind of momentum it is good to see them investing in current trends. This will pay off long term. If RL were trading at the median PE of its peer group the stock would see a 27% gain. If it were trading at median Price/Revenue we would see a 22% gain. My long term price target for RL is thus a 25% gain putting us at about $212/share.

A quick look at the balance sheet. EPS is up 28% YoY with Revenue mostly flat at 2.9% increase YoY. Interestingly, the street estimates that 2025 Revenue will only increase 2.35%. I believe analysts are missing the trend and growing momentum behind RL. Increased sales volume will lead a surge in revenue growth, and assuming margin improvements persist you will see a much greater increase in EPS.

# Technicals

https://preview.redd.it/u2olfdnx3y9d1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3ed3329f935ac14abfa193a34433eae15d15fb

For a quick look at technicals, RL's monster earnings in February broke them out of a long term channel and price has been volatile since. The earnings pump sold off only to pump on their earnings again in late May. The stock is finding support at a long term Fibonacci level around $170. Momentum looks shit right now, it is on the lower end of the bollinger bands and looking oversold on the stochastic. I'm looking to buy around the $170 Fibonacci and psychological support and will continue to buy down to $160.

(P/S, P/B, P/E, hedge fund buying, analyst opinions, and overall position cost distribution)

It appears we are currently seeing a sweep of buyside liquidity at the 2/4/2020 low of $77, I'll be looking for conformation of this sweep with a low timeframe break in structure to the upside (a confirmed uptrend on the 5 min chart tmrw morning) to go long and pick up some cheeky call contracts along with my current small stock position. But...

If CPI and Powell this week tank the market and fear for nike's future is still high, we could see sweep of pandemic lows at $60. If this happens, we could witness one of the greatest trade opportunities of all time!

Cyberdyne systems from Terminator IRL. These guys are leading the pack in making drones and robotic systems that don't need a human holding their hand. They're the go-to for the U.S. military and allied forces, dealing in uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), ground robot systems, and those badass loitering munitions that are like flying ninjas for the modern battlefield.

#Core Products:

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS):

Small UAS: Think of these as your high-tech RC planes. The Puma, Raven, and Wasp models are small but mighty, perfect for spying over the next hill or the next country.
Medium UAS: The Arcturus UAV is like the Puma on steroids‚Äîbigger, badder, and flies longer for those times you really need to snoop.

Tactical Missile Systems:

Switchblade: Imagine a kamikaze drone that can precision strike with minimal blowback. Yeah, it‚Äôs that cool.

Blackwing: Ever wanted a drone that can launch from underwater and spy on people? Now you can.

#Business Acquisitions: 

AeroVironment isn‚Äôt just resting on their laurels. They‚Äôve been shopping around, picking up companies like Arcturus for their badass medium-range drones and Telerob for their bomb-disposal robots. They're like the Walmart of death machines, expanding their aisle every chance they get.

#Financial Performance:

Revenue: Tiny bump to $440 million in 2024, up from $431 million. Not Tesla numbers, but we like the steady climb.

Profitability: Holding steady at $35 million net income. Not too shabby for a company playing with flying robots.

Liquidity and Capital Resources: They‚Äôre sitting on a cash pile of $186.6 million. That‚Äôs a lot of robot parts!
Debt and Liquidity Risks:

Debt Levels: AeroVironment is basically debt-free. They owe some pocket change but nothing that‚Äôs gonna break the bank.

Liquidity: With a current ratio of 7.5, these guys can cover their bills and then some.
Conclusion:

AeroVironment is flying high with their techy toys and solid financials. Minimal debt and solid market position mean this stock could blast off like one of their drones. Just remember, I‚Äôm not your financial advisor, but I‚Äôd say keep an eye on AVAV‚Äîcould be worth a YOLO if you‚Äôre feeling spicy.

Why SPX Could Hit 6000 by Year-En,5,1dsyyae,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dsyyae/why_spx_could_hit_6000_by_yearen/,6,"There's an interesting seasonal pattern with the SPX. In the second half of the year, the index tends to rise more frequently and significantly than in the first half.

Moreover, if there was a notable increase in the first half, like the 14.48% this year, growth in the second half is almost inevitable.

If we plot the second half's performance on the trend line‚Äîthat is, the line that minimizes the distance from all points on the chart‚Äîwe can expect an additional +10%, with a very narrow range of possible values.

The low dispersion intrigued me the most. It almost rules out the possibility of ending the year below 5600, and more likely points to a level closer to 6000

DRAFTKINGS,39,1dsivlk,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dsivlk/draftkings/,43,"Draftkings is arguably approaching it‚Äôs most popular season of the year, Fantasy Football. With price targets averaged at $53.86 with a ‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù rating, currently, DKNG is UNDERVALUED BY 44%. On top of this, the RSI is sitting at 41, almost OVERSOLD, and the MacD is at -0.15. This typically shows downward momentum, but these also often indicate a strong reversal in stock direction is approaching. 

Draftkings also has great financials, reporting a 57% YOY revenue increase, according to the quarter ending March 31, with projected 31-36% YOY  growth in revenue for fiscal year 2024. 

Despite this, the short interest in DraftKings (DKNG) has risen by 26.69% since its last report, with 21.32 million shares sold short, which is 4.51% of all regular shares available for trading. And I know short interest is a shot in the dark, but it definitely means something in situations like this where a strong stock is already 50% undervalued and hasn‚Äôt even hit it‚Äôs most popular season yet. 

With all of this considered, I believe DKNG is a STRONG investment, and specifically September (when NFL season begins) calls may be an absolute banger for most.

ASTS,239,1ds6706,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ds6706/asts/,254,"AST D2D 5G technology is ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. This will commence at the end of Sept when they launch 5 sats - BB1s. 5 sats which will provide 125 milly revs next year and already have AST EBIDTA break even purportedly. The plan is to produce 4 sats per month next year and beyond. Approx 100 sats are needed to be fully operational. 

AST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them 10 years to establish. Starlink tend to be who people fear the most re competition. There is a misconception that Starlink are ahead of the game with anything to do with space based communication services. Starlink are largely in a diff lane - broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. Even in their main area of focus, broadband, their tech is expensive and clunky - requiring a receiver for functionality. They‚Äôve literally just announced in the last year or two that they‚Äôre going to get involved in the D2D space. How many years behind AST are they? Maybe 5? Maybe more?‚Ä¶

AST have MOU‚Äôs with over 50 MNO‚Äôs including Vodafone and Rakuten. They have recently signed commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon, as well as received strategic funding from both companies. This is what led to a recent share price surge as the sole remaining short thesis - funding risks/dilution - was invalidated. Furthermore, AST are set to dominate the US market with AT&T and Verizon on board. Imo it seems likely T-Mobile, who have a relationship with Starlink, will have to follow suit because Starlink have no service to offer them and won‚Äôt for many years, if ever. The scant short thesis has now evaporated and they have started to cover - as seen by a 30% or so reduction in short interest over the last month. AST have said there will be no more dilution this year. It seems there will be no more public offerings full stop going forward as AST have 50 MNO‚Äôs yet to formalise commercial agreements with - many of whom will provide strategic investment/funding via revenue prepayment and convertible loans. 

AT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST‚Äôs service when available. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through existing agreements with MNO‚Äôs. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles/companies providing signal - a problem which AST will solve). It also doesn‚Äôt include governmental/DoD contracts or the use of day passes. 

So to give you an idea of revenue potential: 

We don‚Äôt know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.

So pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn‚Äôt include dead zone users, governmental contracts, day passes and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). AST will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price. While this share price may sound crazy, considering ASTS is currently 11.50 per share or so, it‚Äôs really not. Transhumanica have a 500 PT by 2030 and Deutsche Bank have a PT of 676 by 2027. Have you ever seen a firm slap a 60x PT on a stock?

My approach - retirement or bust. 


Edit: Re potential government contracts - first responders and the military have an obvious need to eliminate dead zones.

All DoD contracts go through Fairwinds Technology. Fairwinds Technology have tweeted about AST‚Äôs technology. 

First Net have 8 billion allocated and available to improve connectivity. First Net work with AT&T. First Net have also tweeted about AST. 

Contracts with both First Net and Fairwinds are inevitable imo.

Consequently, under current federal law, the DEA has the right to raid every shop in every state, shut them all down, and arrest the owners, managers, and employees.\n\nRescheduling cannabis to a Schedule III drug will not legalize cannabis under Federal law. It will only make it a ""prescription"" drug in the same class as: ketamine, anabolic steroids, and lower dosage codeine.  Hence, IF rescheduling happens, states still cannot fully ""legalize"" cannabis as state laws will not affect the Federal ""prescription"" requirement. (Note: The DEA doesn\'t seem keen on the rescheduling because every marijuana ""shop"" would have to register with the DEA and comply with strict rules (more red tape and expense). There are also international treaty concerns regarding enforcement of drug laws as they currently exist. )\n\nIMHO, even after rescheduling, if voters in any super red state with extremist political leaders ever ""legalize"" cannabis under state law, radical state and local politicians will probably strangle shops with inane rules, regs, and fees that will bankrupt any potential cannabis entrepreneur.

He clearly wants to stay in - he could turn to legalization in order to stay in since his seat is much more threatened now given how the media has postured themselves. And he has already reclassified weed. However, I am not invested in any weed stocks still. As I do not think Biden is truly on board with it. He once said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to be able to see the studies that it‚Äôs safe‚Äù when asked about legalization. Lmao.

Turns out people say and do very different things. Everyone bashed Netflix publicly, but only a fraction of a fraction of those people actually unsubscribed. We‚Äôve seen with absolute certainty that the average consumer is going to keep paying for Netflix no matter how much they charge. They‚Äôre literally just reinventing cable at this point, and consumers are willing to let it happen.\n\nI genuinely think it‚Äôs a real possibility Netflix can keep jacking their prices over the next decade until the base subscription is $80+. Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt shock me to see them start splitting off their Netflix originals as ‚Äúpremium‚Äù content that needed additional subscriptions to unlock. \n\nThis is a company that‚Äôs still in the early stages of completely replacing legacy TV/media and I see a not-too-distant future where they‚Äôll be worth well over $1000 a share.

They\'re raising prices, cracking down on password sharing, implementing ads, and instead of dropping a season up binge, going back to weekly shows. \nI don\'t know if it will be Netflix, but I see a clear winner coming out in the streaming service and combining services. Disney is kind of doing it with hulu and espn.  Imagine if HBO Max never became profitable so they sold the rights to Disney. Then they pick up ""cult"" channel like AMC+ when Walking Dead was popular. Instead of paying for 5 different services, It will all be on one platform, likely Disney. Disney just got the NBA deal.

With Boeings Public Reputation in the Toilet how do we Feel about Airbus?,268,1drptf9,wallstreetbets,https://i.redd.it/16x9b0zvyl9d1.jpeg,113,"Hey fellow regards, 

I normally don‚Äôt interact with this sub but I wanted to get some opinions because I‚Äôm a horrible investor and a full stop moron. BUT! I had a notion hit me the other day after watching the congressional hearing with the Boeing CEO. It is very clear that the reputational damage that has been done to Boeing will take a long time to repair. So what about the competition such as Air Bus? From my limited knowledge of the aviation world they are the primary competitor, would they not likely receive a progressive uptick in their sales for the foreseeable future? I would think so but the problem is there stock has taken a substantial dip recently so my theory might not be all that smart. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Since Ive already lost $2k from this sub I figured let‚Äôs keep that ball rolling.

The TLDR version is up till now courts would turn to federal regulators that could ""interpret"" ambiguous language however they wanted, essentially ""making up laws"". This is why, for example, the SEC can regulate crypto despite there being no clear-cut legislation. After this ruling, federal judges now have all the power, the regulators are cucked.

This feels like uncharted territory. Definitely going to have long lasting and far reaching implications for markets. Our entire legal system just changed overnight.

Smells bullish to me. Less regulation means more innovation. It also means your breakfast cereal will probably give you cancer. Exciting times ahead.

Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. ‚ÄúBut but FSD and robotaxi‚Äù.

TSLA üìà NVDA üìâ,93,1drhda0,wallstreetbets,https://i.redd.it/18avut4dyj9d1.jpeg,128,"I firmly believe that Tesla (TSLA) has the potential to reach $250 before August, and here's why:

Historical Performance of QQQ in July: Historically, July has been a strong month for the QQQ. Given this historical trend, I expect the bullish momentum in QQQ to influence Tesla‚Äôs price movement.

Capital Rotation from NVIDIA to Other Stocks: The recent surge in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock has captured significant investor interest. As the stock market operates in cycles, I anticipate a capital rotation where investors move profits from one high-performing stock to others. With NVIDIA‚Äôs impressive rally, it‚Äôs likely that investors will take profits and seek opportunities in other promising tech stocks like Tesla. This influx of capital can drive Tesla‚Äôs stock price higher. 

Combined FOMO from Robotaxi Event, Optimus, and Earnings: Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event, the developments around Tesla Optimus, and its earnings report are all highly anticipated. The FOMO on potentially groundbreaking announcements related to Tesla‚Äôs advancements in autonomous driving technology and the Tesla Optimus robot, combined with the anticipation of positive earnings results, can create substantial buying pressure.

I‚Äôll keep you all updated as you tell me I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôve only just started trading last month with $500, but I‚Äôve been able to grow it pretty fast with NVIDIA puts and Tesla calls :)

Nvidia: Not a Darling Anymore,0,1dsp82e,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dsp82e/nvidia_not_a_darling_anymore/,48,"Nvidia after briefly reaching #1 spot by market cap has fallen.

Last week was full of news of Hedge funds and institutional buyers triming their portfolio fearing the stock has risen too rapidly.

Even the annual share holder meeting on 26th June failed to restore the moment and the stock continued to languish at sub 130$ levels.

Some have put blame on Q3 [supposedly a quarter for poor returns for tech stock] while others have pointed out to investor fatigue with the stock.

This morning [1st July], Nvda is down 2% in pre-market and threatening to drop below pre-split levels.

Technical traders have pointed to a gap at 95-99$ that is yet to be filled. 

What to do? 

While Nvidia remains a dominant player in the AI/GPU segment, current softness in the stock and Nasdaq in general allows for some bearish play:

1) Buy Bear Put Spread: 
     Buy 121$ Put
     Sell 120$ Put
With 12th July expiry

2) Sell Bear Call Spread
     Sell 125$ Call
     Buy 126$ Call
With 5th July expiry

BOEING THOUGHTS,23,1drpk6r,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drpk6r/boeing_thoughts/,51,"Hi everyone,

A small-time rookie here. I'm looking for a long-term investment opportunity (3-4 years at least) that promises solid gains. While I aim to maintain a diverse portfolio, I'm considering allocating a substantial portion of my capital to a single company.

One company on my radar is Boeing. Despite the safety issues and incidents they've faced, I find it puzzling that their stock value remains significantly lower than its pre-pandemic levels, especially given the current surge in travel and vacationing among Americans. The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.

With the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think the aviation sector is poised for upliftment or if AI-based companies are going to take away all the capital and any chances of upliftment. Also, what other companies should I be looking at?",2024-06-30 00:49:04,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', ""Pre-COVID stock price was overhyped due to a decade of Boeing spending $43b on share buybacks. Today, every commercial production line is on literal fire and can't procure parts to actually meet current production rates, let alone continuously ramp up as the executives want.\n\nBoeing's largest labor union is also looking for a big contract this year after a 16-year contract (with 2 terrible extensions) - a strike is likely and honestly the company needs one to let suppliers catch up a little. During the MAX grounding and COVID, the company let the top end of its work force (mechanics and engineers) walk with early retirement instead of hitting the bottom seniority with big layoffs, as would have been typical. However, the company didn't bother to capture and transfer that knowledge and experience, and has been begging many of those people to return temporarily ever since. The blue-collar workforce is now very young compared to its historical value despite the 100+ year history, and a ton of basic issues have popped up in production due to the lack of experience. When I hired in early last decade, most of the people around me were 20+ years. Now? Most are 5 years or less...\n\nDefense is running negative margins on basically every recent product because they're mostly fixed-price contracts, and the company can't engineer successful anymore.

Regardless it will be a pump on [X.com](http://X.com) I think it might go up to 140-160.

PS: this is not a joke - NVDA was recommended to me in 2018 by a real autistic man, wearing a long scarf, who went around the coffee shop telling people nearby to 'buy NVDA to ensure your retirement' he also said not to invest your life savings into it though; he bought in at 70 pre pre split.

Albertsons (ACI) Undervalued due to merger.,15,1drlbp9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drlbp9/albertsons_aci_undervalued_due_to_merger/,24,"First off I know Grocery Store may be the least sexy industry ever. However, the current share price of ACI is roughly $19.75 and the merger sale price is 27.25. Assuming the merger goes through that's a 37.97% gain if the merger goes through. However, I see even more potential if the merger fails. A potential of 81.77% gain in a base case. The down side I see is the fact that the stock is probably going to slowly go down over the next few months until the merger decision goes through. There may be a slight uptick coming up on august as the merger trial begins.

Merger goes through: I think this is the less likely case and most people are assuming an incredibly 90%+ chance of the FTC denying this merger but, I think there is some fair reasoning why it might. 1) Walmart is huge. It holds so much market share the merger will still hold less than half of Walmart's market share and the merged company will be just slightly larger than Costco's market share. 2) The companies largely operate in different areas of the U.S. and have been working toward divesting certain stores where the competition would be stopped. 

Merger gets Denied: Probably more likely but, possibly the better outcome for investors. I've done a dcf and get a bear case of roughly $24, a base case of roughly $36, and a bull case of $60. I think since the merger began the company has been letting a lot of extra weight off and making the company more profitable. The companies share price is held down from the merger and the large amount of debt they took on to make the large dividend payment a year ago. The company however has shown it can handle the debt really well and are moving in a great direction. 

I'm not exactly sure what I'm missing because I'm seeing such a good win/win scenario but wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts.

Bearish about AAPL,0,1ds8qu2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ds8qu2/bearish_about_aapl/,40,"Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of companies citing ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in their earnings calls has exploded, with 199 S&P 500 companies mentioning it at least once in their Q1 2024 calls. However, management optimism still hasn‚Äôt translated to company profits.

Despite mentioning ‚ÄúAI‚Äù 40 times in its Q1 2024 earnings call, Adobe‚Äôs management predicted decelerating earnings and revenue growth of 12% and 10%, respectively, and its stock fell by 13.7% that day.

Similarly, Salesforce and Dell, which had both tripled between December 2022 and May 2024 on AI optimism, fell 18% and 15%, respectively, after their May earnings calls, with Morgan Stanley analysts noting that GenAI bookings still hadn‚Äôt improved Salesforce‚Äôs top line, while Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked if Dell was selling its AI servers at zero margin, noting that its $1.7 billion in server revenue didn‚Äôt boost operating profits.

While many companies are surely to profit from AI boom such as NVIDIA from chip sales and Microsoft from cloud compute, will Apple be one of them?

Much of Apples stock boom has been around its AI hype. However, it‚Äôs still yet to see how this translates into more iPhone sales or higher profitability for the company? Are they planning to offer AI as an add-on like Samsung? There‚Äôs also the question of public‚Äôs perception of privacy concerns. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: I‚Äôm currently holding AAPL, considering selling. Here are some other concerns I have. 

- Import Tarifs with either Trump or Biden 
- Falling sales in China with market penetration from Xiaomi and Huawei 
- EU digital marketplace scrutiny and looming fines
- Antitrust lawsuits
- Diminishing marginal returns

Undoubtedly they have been technology leaders with very reliable hardware platforms.  Even those who dislike Apple as a company for other reasons all agree, Apple hardware is solid.  Apple also a dedicated following of customers.  I listened keenly to learn of new innovation coming.  My takeaway?  Theres a new iPhone model with a faster processor with direct hooks into ChatGPT, and we'll get customizable emjoji's.

Following the event I felt Apple is desparately trying to appear relevant in the AI game, but 12 months late.  NVDA and SuperMicro have done well because like in the gold rush of the 1800's, they are selling the shovels to the miners.  Apple doesn't have any shovels and at the moment at least, it appears its lacking a new Killer App which will instantly be a Must Have for anyone with a iPhone model 14 or older.\n\nSo heres a few basic fundamentals i've been considering:\n\n1) Feb 2024, Apple Car project has been shelved after 10 years of R&D\n\n2) March 2024, DOJ files a anti-trust lawsuit against AAPL due to AppStore policy\n\n3) China iPhone sales for Jan to April sales numbers were atrocious so Apple began discounting phones which raised sales somewhere between 44% and 52% for May (different sources presented differing values)\n\n4) Apple has admitted iPhone+ChatGPT will not be immediately available in Europe due to Digital Markets Act\n\n5) China has banned ChatGPT usage domestically\n\n6) OpenAI is restricting usage of ChatCPT for Hong Kong and China\n\n7) Barclays is one of the few ratings agencies skeptical of near-term Apple growth.\n\nThere may be other factors, but these are ones I've been pondering which lead me to feel very bearish as they hit near ATH.   Maybe I'm just a uber regard, but I'm skeptical Apple's fan base buying iPhone 16's will be enough to sustain their current price."", ""Apple doesn't invent shit\n\nApple adapts and integrates\n\nApple Intelligence is already announced and the company will reap future benefits from AI, like they did with every other technology\n\nAAPL might not be NVDA, but it is a safe bet""]"

Accessibility: Robotaxis could provide a reliable transportation option for those who cannot afford a personal vehicle. This can significantly enhance mobility for people in lower-income brackets, the elderly, and those with disabilities.

Cost Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles can operate around the clock without the need for a human driver, reducing operational costs. This could result in more affordable ride-hailing services, making transportation more economical for everyone.

Traffic and Emissions Reduction: Autonomous vehicles can optimize routes and improve traffic flow, potentially reducing congestion. With a fleet of electric robotaxis, the overall emissions could decrease, contributing to cleaner air in urban areas.

Safety Improvements: AI-driven vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents caused by error. Enhanced safety features and constant monitoring can make roads safer for all users.

Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of robotaxis could influence urban planning. Cities might repurpose parking spaces for green areas, pedestrian zones, or other community uses, as the need for personal vehicle ownership decreases.

Economic Impact: The development and deployment of robotaxis can create new job opportunities in tech, maintenance, and infrastructure development, while also potentially displacing traditional driving jobs. This shift will require new training and adaptation in the workforce.

Environmental Benefits: As Tesla's fleet is electric, robotaxis will likely reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.

Socioeconomic Impact: By providing affordable and efficient transportation, robotaxis can help bridge the mobility gap, enabling people from various socioeconomic backgrounds to access better job opportunities, education, and healthcare.

Tesla's leadership in AI and autonomous driving technology positions it well to drive this change. The company's existing infrastructure, extensive research, and development in AI and energy storage solutions provide a strong foundation for the successful implementation of robotaxis. If Tesla's robotaxi service can overcome regulatory and technical challenges, it has the potential to transform the transportation landscape significantly",2024-06-30 18:04:45,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 171 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'This sub hates Tesla.

**Metalworking Facing Higher Costs**

The PPI in Metalworking peaked to all time high percent change from year ago at 10% in September 2022. The YoY change has come down since then with the percent change at 4.9% for May 2024. This has decreased MSM‚Äôs gross profit dollar and margin from $411M to $388M and 43% to 42% from May 2022 to March 2024 respectively. MSM stock is down 26% from all time high back in October 2023. This high PPI is priced in the stock; the percent change from a year ago gradual decline can serve as a positive welcome for MSM moving forward as gross profit margins have started trending back upwards.

**Technical Analysis**

An inverse cup and handle pattern occurred during 2021 prior to October 20^(th), 2021. The earnings results were underwhelming, and the stock dropped near 5%. One can argue that there was also a head and shoulder pattern to suggest downside.

Now let‚Äôs compare to today. An inverse cup is present but without the handle and there is no clear head and shoulder pattern compared to October 2021. With the stock already down 26% the known headwinds for the company is already priced in ‚Äì a slight positive nudge on the call may be enough for the stock to increase this earnings on Tuesday before market open. The stock currently sits at $78.01 which is a key price support and resistance line.

PYPL DD Long,20,1drezx2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drezx2/pypl_dd_long/,30,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Everyone trades at their own risk. This is solely my personal opinion. I do not receive any compensation for this. I am positioned in PYPL. I am a retail investor.

PayPal has experienced a significant decline in its stock price in recent weeks. In this due diligence, I aim to outline my market expectations for the next two to three weeks incorporating current data.

Market Expectation and Fundamental Reasons:
A key reason for PayPal's sell-off could be increasing competition, including from Apple Pay. This may lead to intensified competition and potential market share loss for PayPal. However, PayPal and Apple Pay may cater to different target audiences. Many individuals regularly use PayPal alongside their traditional bank accounts. I certainly do. Invest in companies whose products you use.

Current Valuation:
As of June 28, 2024, PayPal's stock price was $58.03 USD. The Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E) stands at 14.58, based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.98 USD. The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) is 1.99 and the Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) is 2.93. Historically, PayPal appears significantly undervalued, given the average P/E ratio of the last nine years was 44.65.

Market Sentiment and Technical Analysis:
The overall market has shown positive performance in 2024, driven particularly by the 'Mag Seven' companies. However, market breadth remains constrained, indicating many stocks are still undervalued. A sector rotation in the second half of 2024 could benefit fintechs like PayPal, especially if interest rate expectations decline and AI technology is leveraged for efficiency gains.

Technical Indicators and Sentiment:
PayPal's Dealer Gamma Exposure (GEX) recently stood at -30, coupled with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicating an oversold market sentiment. Bullish divergence within the overarching bearish scenario suggests a possible bottom formation. Support zones in the technical picture reinforce this assumption. Historically, July has been an attractive month for PayPal with high returns. A near-panic sell-off could reverse sharply due to Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). A rapid upward movement.

The negative GEX could, in a highly unlikely scenario, catalyze a small Gamma Squeeze.

Volatility and Short Interest:
Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased, interpreted as a bullish signal because it could possibly drop further. PYPL's volatility has also significantly decreased. Short interest for PayPal stands at approximately 2% of outstanding shares, relatively low, indicating moderate investor confidence. Open interest of put-call options also shows a relatively balanced positioning.

In summary, the analysis suggests PayPal has promising prospects despite short-term challenges. Fundamental and technical indicators support the belief that PayPal could see positive developments, particularly in July and throughout the year.

I anticipate broader market increases and sector rotations. Undervalued stocks are likely to gain momentum. Therefore, I am LONG on PYPL.",2024-06-29 16:26:54,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 10 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 90 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 10 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'what exactly is your position?

ON RR soared on friday indicating a temporary liquidity drain,10,1drhk3o,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1drhk3o/on_rr_soared_on_friday_indicating_a_temporary/,6,"Since monday the 17th of june, there has been inflows into the Over Night Reverse Repurchase agreement. This is indicative of a drain of liquidity from the markets and with the largest inflow this last friday, just happened to coincide with the intraday 1.75% drop we saw on the nasdaq. Often times, equities bottom AFTER, ON RR outflows begin. This leads me to believe we have several more days of selling to ensue this week. I will be watching the ON RR data as it comes in and will likely lighten up my short positions as the outflow begins, and look for long opportunities in the market.

I was getting back into options after taking a year break. Over 6 years I was down almost $30k.\n\nOver a month ago I set eyes on MU and bought $120C for 7/19, $500 worth. It tripled in value after a few weeks, MU was already past the strike. I decided to place a much larger stake for earnings, I wanted to erase my previous losses and go back to just buying shares. Took out a loan for $17k. I put it into a variety of MU calls, quickly went up to +$12k. I was very happy, but I knew it wouldn't be enough. I wanted to erase my mistakes, and this seemed like as good of a chance as I was going to get. I wanted to reposition so I sold my options, planning to buy back in ASAP. I don't have margin available so I had to wait until the next day for the funds to settle. The next day it was like +5% at market open. I thought okay it's obviously going to go back down so I waited it out, but some puts. but it was +3% like two days in a row after that. So I thought damn okay, price targets are all being raised to like +20%, this is going to stay here or rise until earnings and then really pop. I bought back in, fully. That did not happen. It just kept going down. After it was down quite a bit from the peak I realized that even a +200% wouldn't cut it, so I put another $5k in. \n\nMorning of 6/26 I had like $16k, up $2k from the previous few days. It was doing good in premarket, I felt good about it. I was planning to listen in on the earnings call, my first one. I thought I saw somewhere that it was at 6pm. I checked the stock at like 4:30 and saw that it was down 10%... freaked out. I thought maybe this was sort of normal for earnings calls, right before the call the stock might go up or down but it won't be very indicative. but I looked up the earnings call and I guess it had started already, so this was the actual result and this situation was real.\n\nwhen it was down 6% i checked the simulated returns and saw that I should be down like 60%. well, at least it's not everything. i realized it might not be taking the expected volatility from ER into account. that guess was correct, I was down 91% at market open. i had $500 left, I put it into a TSM call. aside from that i'm just going to focus on paying back this personal loan... part of me hopes that i never do this shit again, part of me hopes that i do it again and finally win once and for all. sigh.\n\ni'm still doing fine financially, even though this loss was huge. i have $10k in the bank, so this loan is more than the amount that i actually have. but it's $366/mo, for five years. i'll probably pay it off sooner than that. I'm 24 and making $87k in a medium COL area, so overall i'm still okay. it's easy for me to cope. it's not my first time so it really doesn't sting that much.\n\nif i learned *anything*, it's to not buy expensive options. out of curiosity i checked the puts, and the recently-ITM puts were *down 50%*. i made some bad decisions, but the whole time i was wondering if it was overall just a bad move to buy these options since they were so expensive. i think the correct answer was yes."", 'Bag holder here assuming this will go up eventually and make some money, just not to the moon like everyone played up before earnings', 'Me too.

**Abstract:** This paper explores the pervasive presence of fractal and chaotic patterns in everyday objects and natural phenomena, drawing parallels with their manifestation in financial market dynamics. By elucidating how patterns observed in crumpled fabric, tree branches, and mountain ranges mirror those seen in stock market charts, this study unveils underlying principles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Understanding these connections not only enriches our theoretical frameworks of complexity and order but also holds profound implications for predictive modeling and strategic decision-making in financial markets.

**Introduction:** Patterns are fundamental to both natural systems and human-made constructs, influencing perception and predictive analytics across disciplines. In financial markets, identifying and interpreting patterns such as trend reversals, breakouts, and support-resistance levels is crucial for informed decision-making. Conversely, observations of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics in everyday phenomena suggest a deeper coherence and underlying order that may inform novel insights in investment strategies.

**Literature Review:** Synthesizing seminal works from mathematics, physics, ecology, and finance, this review establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding fractal and chaotic patterns across diverse domains. Key concepts include self-similarity across scales, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the role of pattern recognition in human cognition and decision-making processes. By contextualizing these concepts within the realms of financial markets and natural phenomena, this review sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration into their interconnectedness and practical implications.

**Methodology:** This study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced computational algorithms with qualitative analysis to identify and quantify fractal patterns in both financial data and visual representations of natural structures. Case studies include detailed analyses of crumpled fabrics, tree line formations, and mountainous topographies, where fractal dimensions and recurrence plots highlight structural similarities with market trends. Statistical validation ensures robustness in pattern identification, facilitating actionable insights and predictive modeling applications.

**Results and Discussion:** The findings underscore striking parallels between financial market dynamics and natural phenomena, revealing how fractal and chaotic patterns manifest universally. The crumpled fabric exhibits patterns resembling trend lines with breakouts and retracements, akin to market behaviors observed in asset prices. Analogously, natural structures such as tree branches and coastlines demonstrate fractal properties mirroring market volatility and trend formations. This holistic understanding not only enriches theoretical frameworks but also positions these insights as pivotal in informing strategic decision-making and risk management strategies in financial markets.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this paper posits fractal and chaotic patterns as foundational elements underlying complexity and order in both natural and financial systems. By elucidating their presence in everyday phenomena, from fabric folds to geological formations, we advance our understanding of predictive analytics and strategic foresight in investment management. Embracing this interdisciplinary perspective not only fosters innovation in financial analysis but also underscores the intrinsic unity and interconnectedness of diverse systems. As we navigate the complexities of global markets, harnessing the insights derived from fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics holds transformative potential in navigating uncertainty and unlocking hidden opportunities.",2024-06-29 21:23:37,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 10 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Confirmation bias is a thing.', 'I think the writer, the cowriters, the reviewer, the publisher, the university, the dean, the printer and the computer this was written on were all high as fuck\xa0', 'Dump money without the money part.', 'Forgot to label as shitpost']"

Bank of America's  will offer Structured Financial products on Wells Fargo stock, with a 10% annual yield.

Bank of America will check Well's Fargo's closing price on July 05 2024 to determine the reference price.

|| || |October 7, 2024|| |January 6, 2025|| |April 7, 2025|| |July 7, 2025|| |October 6, 2025|| |January 5, 2026|| |April 6, 2026|| |July 6, 2026|| |October 5, 2026|| |January 5, 2027|| |April 5, 2027|

If the closing price of Wells Fargo stock is below 44-46 per share on any of the above dates, the bond will be liquidated for a 100% loss. All coupon payments made prior to the liquidation will not be affected. If the price finishes above the July 05 2024 closing price on any of the above dates, the bond will be redeemed early and no further coupon payments will be made.

All of the above days are a Monday :)

Knowing that these rich people will try to earn the maximum return on these bonds,  They will likely attempt to keep the price below 60 on Wells Fargo stock on the dates above, and just above 44-46 to avoid liquidation.

Bank of America will offer structured products for the S&P 500 index. The bond holder either gets a 13% return if the price of the index is higher than the reference price at maturity or their money back.

BYND Regsho Cash Cow Cycle,33,1dqsdlb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqsdlb/bynd_regsho_cash_cow_cycle/,34,"Beyond Meat (BYND) is a heavily shorted company as many of you are aware with a high short interest of 39%+ its float.

On the start of June 27 th trading day BYND entered the regsho inclusion list where the stock has huge price increases on regsho.

What is regsho?

As defined in Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ‚Äúthreshold security‚Äù is any equity security of any issuer that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (commonly referred to as reporting securities), where, for five consecutive settlement days:

ÔÇ∑ There are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security;

ÔÇ∑ The level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding; and

ÔÇ∑ The security is included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).

A security ceases to be a threshold security if it does not exceed the specified level of fails for five consecutive settlement days.

A security can be added on this because the failures to settle can be a sign of high shorting and improper naked short selling as you can see from the stock‚Äôs high short interest.

When BYND is on regsho it is extremely hard to short with limited liquidity and the high cost to borrow rate (IBKR‚Äôs retail fee

currently at 111.7216%), there is also a prime rate but that‚Äôs for the bigger players probably around 15-20% which is extremely high regardless. This can lead to an increase in the price of BYND.

After T+13 (13 trading days after its been included to the list) force covering begins where they are forced to cover the amount on the first day of regsho inclusion until the stock is off regsho.

The last two times BYND has been on Regsho the shorts ran the stock up on t+13 th day.

[BYND Chart and regsho trading days](https://preview.redd.it/lce8w2oo8d9d1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37f1671f306c73c0986791d6c8a54739857199)

As you can see on feb7th BYND entered regsho (see teal lines on chart) and leading up to t+13 the stock‚Äôs price gradually increased and the t+13 th day they decided to cover all their obligations which lead to a huge pump.

This happened to be also the earnings day of bynd where they decided to use earnings as a cover.

FC on the chart stands for forced covering where they have to force cover their obligations.

FC +1 means they have to cover whats due on the first day of regsho.

FC +2 means they have to cover what‚Äôs due on the 2 nd day of regsho. Etc.

Fast forward to the last time BYND was on regsho on Apr25th (see purple lines on chart). Again the stock‚Äôs price increased leading to the t+13 th day of regsho where on the t+13 th day they covered majority of their obligations which lead to the huge pump

Now BYND has entered regsho on June 27 th where the regsho just about started. In the past this has lead to a huge priceincrease in the stock as the shorts are now incentivized to get off the regsho list by covering their obligations. Mind you they might not run the stock up on the t+13 th trading day, it could be earlier or later where they wait for earnings on Aug 1st or after it. Also the November regsho run it took 1month for them to run it up

So we got BYND on regsho and ETF FTDs that are coming due.

My Positions are: 8c July 19th , 9c July 19th , 10c Aug16th, 12c Aug16th

This is a regsho cash cow cycle. Milk responsibly.

Also this is not financial advice.

TLDR: BYND is on regsho and when on regsho it has lead to huge price improvements.",2024-06-28 19:43:40,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 7 minutes ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqs7p6/bynd_regsho_cash_cow_cycle/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'I read about 37% of this and couldn‚Äôt understand half of it so all in', 'TLDR ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)', 'so expect big ups by tues July 16 or July 17th?', 'I rarely see a post that seems logical and well thought out, so I suppose it‚Äôs worth a try on Monday!', 'Does their chief still bite people on the nose???', ""I'm in, bought some calls"", ""I'm in and ready for $8."", 'Positions?', 'Fuck it got some 10c‚Äôs for 07/19', 'No idea what a regshew is but I am not going to look back on this and say i missed it.

My second option is depositing the $200 into PocketOption. 

Robinhood: 
-Easy to use
-Familiar and usual trading platform
-not tradable during night and weekends
-no minimum withdrawal

PocketOption:
- Learning the platform
- tradable 24/7
-minimum withdrawal of $100

The short float is under 4% this tells us the market, and Wall Street are bearish on the stock. The cherry on top is Deltas earnings report comes in on the 11 of July, I believe this earnings report will out preform what is expected which would lead to a jump in stock price. To be clear I am offering you a stock below average price with solid long term performance predictions, with the potential opportunity for an early profitable exit if the earnings report is positive.

For example, I screenshotted the SPY IV and HV overlay. At the place where its circled the IV is 3 times higher than the HV. But becayse the Y axis is the percentage, these lines are overlapping rather than the HV line being way higher than the IV line. Can anyone help with configuring this Y axis issue when you overlay 2 studies? Thanks

"Five Below Shares & Leaps - You Don't ""Need Them"" But You Want Them!",16,1dqo9s8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqo9s8/five_below_shares_leaps_you_dont_need_them_but/,13,"TLDR; Five Below (FIVE) is down 40% on the year but it‚Äôs a hit with it‚Äôs core market, has executed well on store expansion (+70% store count in 5 years, including over Covid), and all negativity (Sometimes people steal stuff, TikTok is trendy) has been priced in. One opened in my neighborhood 6 months ago and everyone (kids, friends, grandparents, little league coaches, gang of ebike teens) loves the place. Long on Shares & Leaps.

**Tween & Teen Powered Growth**:

Five Below has a ‚Äúunique focus on Teen and Tween‚Äù customers. Store locations align to this as well as their product offering.¬†

This place is nailing it. In our neighborhood using ‚Äúwe can go to Five Below‚Äù has become a reward dangled in front of children for great behavior, youth sport events, and general kid bribery. It's clear their offering hits on this with less expensive trendy products (think unbranded Stanley Mugs, Prime drinks, and popular character licensed gear). I love this place for the ability to get useful items but not break the bank. What used to be designate as a trip to Target has shifted to Five instead where we spend a fraction of the cost, get effectively the same things, and don‚Äôt have to walk past dozens of irrelevant departments.

While the offering is a unique focus that helps them build brand and drive store expansion, there is a ton of opportunity left on the table to cater to others in the family. Dollar stores also are hot for being recession proof.¬†¬†

FIVE hasn‚Äôt even completed expansion in the US, notably they have no stores in the Pacific Northwest. Not to mention there has been no international expansion. Their expansion has come with no debt, new stores have minimal build out since fixtures are so basic and the merchandising aligns to a warehouse style clean look. The footprint works at nearly any size and they can slot into countless open leases as other retailers struggle in a downturn and are forced to close stores.

**Financials and Other DD**:

Four years ago one user wrote some great DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five\_below\_going\_to\_drop\_hard\_on\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv05tm/five_below_going_to_drop_hard_on_earnings/)) and suggested buying puts since they had just made distribution center investment, couldn‚Äôt sustain store growth. Since that post they‚Äôve grown store count by 75%, grown comparable store sales by 20% ($2.0M>$2.5M), grown EPS +144% ($2>$5+), peaked at +100% stock price ($108>$215), and are now trading at the same SAME value ($108).

There is already an approved outstanding $100M buyback that has been untouched. For a company delivering $5 EPS already it‚Äôs easy to see how a growth motivated leadership team would execute on this even if the rest of the store & revenue growth slows down. In the past few years they‚Äôve done similar buy-backs at an average cost between $158-$162/share so no doubt they‚Äôll be executing this and likely green lighting more.

Part of the value of Five Below is that the stores are easy to open, allowing for fast store growth. The footprint is only 9500 sq ft, which makes them easy to locate in dozens of struggling shopping areas where they can take over leases. Typically they are spending <$400k to open a store and have a one-year payback on the investment. Even after completing plans to expand to 3k stores with this model there is tons of room for new concepts of smaller or larger footprints that leverage the same distribution network they are building. Not that places like Dollar General has around 20k stores while even original WSB darlings have 6k+ stores.

50Day moving average just touched the 200day moving average

**Is it Just ‚Äú$5 and Below‚Äù**:

No. The core SKU offering is based on quality low priced goods, primarily $5-$10.¬† That said my local store has expanded their ‚ÄúFive Beyond‚Äù in-store footprint to be \~25% of the square footage. There is plenty of upside to drive total $ per store up which would have a huge impact given that this metric has been flat over the past 24 months. Management has already said they expect this to drop in the short term, but this is baked into the guidance.

It‚Äôs been 5 years since ‚Äú5 Below‚Äù moved to price some items over $5 and growth has still been solid. Despite the name there is no backlash to not adhering to a hard $5 cap on items and even in the face of inflation there are dozens of entry level items that will continue to be available at this price.

A big knock on the stock is that it is a physical retailer with minimal online presence. This makes sense though, even the behemoth Amazon struggles to compete in goods priced at this level. It‚Äôs nearly impossible for Amazon to make $$ on <$10 items due to shipping and the huge cost of returns. It‚Äôs a defensible fall back to have physical stores and funding a distribution network from this is a great move. Again I see this as a growth potential as they expand the price point of their offering distribution network that serves 1500+ retail locations in the continental US serves as a great basis to handle ecommerce orders reliably.¬†

**Risks**:

* The biggest hit to guidance came with notes about shrinkage being on the rise. This makes sense, the local store is often staffed by a single individual and tons of items are small and easy to hide.¬†
* Retail is a hard business. Specialty shops have their place but FIVE still has yet to show they can expand outside of trends/tweens.¬†
* Inventory management is hard. With store growth FIVE has better negotiating terms with suppliers, but also risks over buying trend items and having to discount them. Recent articles from Q2 earnings note difficulties here for things like Squishmallows and Faux Stanley cups (both driven by TikTok trends). Toys, Seasonal, and Trends are notorious for this but again here expanding out of just the Tween market to offer commodities for all helps reduce this risk as would a more ‚Äúseek and find‚Äù approach of under buying trend items and making them foot traffic drivers with regular restocks. At the same time when other retailers over load on inventory with classic channel stuffing from manufacturers Five Below is in a position to gobble that up and resell it in their stores. Places like Ross Stores (equal store count but 10x market cap thanks to larger store foot print) have done great with this model.

Infinite Money?????,7,1dquwa9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dquwa9/infinite_money/,14,"# The Plan: December 2026 Options

Options in Play:

1. Long Call: Buy the 18th Dec 2026 $540 Call
2. Short Call: Sell the 18th Dec 2026 $545 Call

# Why This Should Work

SPY's Historical Performance: SPY has a strong track record of growth. By 2026, there's a high probability that SPY will be well above our target price, especially given its historical resilience and growth patterns.

Break-Even Point**:** We set the break-even point just $1 above the current price. This is a conservative estimate, giving us a wide margin for profit.

# The Strategy: Call Debit Spread

By using a call debit spread, we can minimize our initial outlay while maximizing potential profits. Here's how:

1. Buy the $540 Call (Long Call)**:** This gives us the right to buy SPY at $540 by Dec 2026.
2. Sell the $545 Call (Short Call)**:** This obligates us to sell SPY at $545, capping our maximum profit but also reducing our initial cost.

# Final Thoughts

This strategy hinges on SPY's continued upward trajectory, which is a reasonable assumption given its historical performance. By setting our break-even point conservatively and leveraging a call debit spread, we can potentially unlock significant profits with a controlled risk. I also understand for this strategy to be effective; you would need to invest a considerably large capital to make some serious profit.

My thesis:

VF Corp has undoubtedly made some regarded decisions the past couple years, but the turnaround starts now and this is the bottom. 

Every move they have made in the past year tells me this thing is going to turn around in a big way. 

 They brought in the turnaround goat himself, Bracken Darrell who has a history of saving big name companies in the likes of Logitech and Old spice.  This guy knows how to balance a sheet and return good brands to flavortown.  And this mf believes in the stock, he has bought over $2 milli worth of shares in the past couple months.  And on a $1.3 million dollar salary that‚Äôs no small amount.  He also brought in Sun Choe, the Lulu creative director, that gets white women everywhere bleeding their bank accounts to buy her clothes.  So the leadership team is stacked from a business and creative standpoint.  

They also announced they‚Äôre looking to deleverage by selling one of their brands (likely supreme) and I think when this goes through it‚Äôs going to be a big mover.  It‚Äôs a negative on the balance sheet, but it‚Äôs attractive enough to warrant a good price.  When they get supreme off the books, the stock is going to jump, it‚Äôs just a question of when it is announced and how high the stock goes.   If it happens in the near term, the 13% short interest is going to lead to a lot of covering and this thing is going to boom.

"How to know which way to play earnings, every time.",210,1dq2icc,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dq2icc/how_to_know_which_way_to_play_earnings_every_time/,111,"Robinhood Gold users know all about the Morningstar report at the bottom of every stock's page that states their opinion of the stock's fair market value according to their ""research.""

Don't worry, you don't need to actually read anything or do any research to win. Just remember this: it's false info meant to manipulate the retail market into picking the opposite direction the stock is going.

**Example:** Morningstar, professionals as they are, proclaim that Nike's fair market value is $129. The average Robinhood user will see this and think to themselves, ""Oh wow, Nike is only at $94 today going into earnings... that must mean it's undervalued and about to skyrocket once efficient markets kick in... What a steal, I should buy calls or shares!"" The only problem is: Nike nosedived after earnings today, going even lower to $88 vs it's ""fair market value"" of $129.

I've done a little experiment and tracked which way earnings have gone depending on the FMV. My theory was that the stock will continue to go in the direction it's already going vs the FMV.

Here are the results of my experiment (6 for 6) -

FMV = Fair Market Value Before Earnings,
Price DBE = Price Day Before Earnings,
Price DAE = Price Day After Earnings

- Nike: FMV $129, Price DBE $94, Price DAE $88 (so far), PUTS win
- FedEx: FMV $240, Price DBE $256, Price DAE $296, CALLS win
- Broadcom: FMV $1350, Price DBE $1493, Price DAE $1678, CALLS win
- Salesforce: FMV $300, Price DBE $272, Price DAE $218, PUTS win
- Walgreens: FMV $33, Price DBE $15, Price DAE $12, PUTS win
- Lululemon: FMV $285, Price DBE $308, Price DAE $323, CALLS win

There are of course counterexamples (Micron), but from what I've seen, it's pretty uncanny and very predictable which way a stock will go based on if the FMV is below the price (it'll keep going up) or above the price (it'll keep going down). I bet someone with more time on their hands could pull these same 3 numbers for every major earnings example, and see what the percentages are of the price following this pattern.

Not financial advice; I just have basic pattern recognition and ADHD.

My next play: First Solar (FSLR) - FMV $185, PBE $250 as of today, so my position is 7/26 $285 calls. (Earnings 7/25)

Rivian Founder in for a great deal if stocks huts 295$ per share,19,1dqa3jo,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqa3jo/rivian_founder_in_for_a_great_deal_if_stocks_huts/,26,"2021 Equity Award to our Founder & Chief Executive Officer

In January 2021, our board of directors and stockholders approved an equity award to Dr. Scaringe consisting of a time-based option to purchase 6,785,315 shares of our Class A common stock and a performance-based option to purchase up to 20,355,946 shares of our Class A common stock (the ‚Äú2021 CEO Equity Award‚Äù).

Our board of directors, in consultation with an independent compensation consultant, considered a number of factors in determining whether to grant the 2021 CEO Equity Award as well as the terms and conditions with respect thereto. Such factors include Dr. Scaringe‚Äôs then-current ownership interest in the Company, external market data for similarly situated executives among comparable companies, and the Company‚Äôs interest in incentivizing Dr. Scaringe to deliver on the Company‚Äôs strategy and align his long-term interests with those of our stockholders.

The time-based option vests in six equal installments on each of the first through sixth anniversaries of a Qualified IPO (as defined in the award agreement), subject to Dr. Scaringe‚Äôs continued service. The performance-based option vests in twelve installments contingent on the achievement of four stock price goals over a performance period that commences on the later of: (i) the sixth anniversary of the grant date and (ii) a Qualified IPO and ends upon the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The four stock price goals are, on a price-per share basis, $110, $150, $220, and $295, in each case as adjusted to reflect the impact of any stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalization or other changes in the corporate structure of the Company. Such stock prices reflect performance-based goals of approximately 5x to 13x increases in our stock price based on the $21.72 exercise price at the time of grant in January 2021.

Achievement of the stock price goals will be assessed on each of three assessment dates: the sixth, eighth and nine-year and sixth month anniversaries of the grant date.

The options each have a ten-year term and generally become exercisable as they vest. The options are also subject to certain forfeiture and accelerated vesting provisions with respect to all or a portion of the award in the event of a change of control, the definition of which does not include a public offering, termination of service to the Company and change in title from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman or any other C-level title.

At the end most analysts seemed to have resigned to the idea, that it is a meme stock, disconnected from financial fundamentals or any real value, riding solely on emotions and support for Donald Trump. At best it was supposed to be a measurement of his followers fervor.

On Thursday, in the deep, deep shadows of everything else, that has happened during the debate and and the discussion about it, that idea died a quiet and lonely death.

If the assessment of DJT being a meme stock and riding the waves of confidence in Donald Trump held up, DJT should have gone through the roof. Instead, while there were small spikes, representing how much positive sentiment was present in the share price, the stock started sliding over Friday, once more sheddding a lot of it¬¥s superfluous value over the course of a single day.

As far as the idea of meme stocks go, this is a red flag, big enough to cover a May Parade in Moscow, while Paul Revere is galloping off and the beacons of Gondor are lit.

The 20 SMA has crossed the 50, and both are above the 200 SMA, with an RSI of 50, and decent volume all on the daily chart. It seems HD dipped on Tuesday largely in sympathy with POOL even though HD (and Lowe‚Äôs) seem to have larger markets and larger market shares within that larger market than POOL does in its own. HD has long been a solid company that generally outperforms the EPS, and only missed Revenue in April after several quarters of surpassing.

Turns out that Verona Pharma Plc is a medical company that 'engages in the development and commercialization of therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases. It focuses on developing inhaled ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.¬†'  Ok whatever, sounds cool, but these types of companies are usually shit.

So I looked at Webull analyst section and found an average buy target of 34 with a low of 30 and a recent article (from today) confirming their $35 price target - [https://quantisnow.com/insight/canaccord-genuity-maintains-buy-on-verona-pharma-maintains-35-price-target-5580590](https://quantisnow.com/insight/canaccord-genuity-maintains-buy-on-verona-pharma-maintains-35-price-target-5580590)

Cool, and the current price is only 15 bucks?

The conditions are not bad; no new drug has been approved for COPD in more than 10 years and many patients are dissatisfied with their therapy.

DD FCX,12,1dq1vio,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dq1vio/dd_fcx/,14,"Due Diligence: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

**Executive Summary**
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the surging demand for copper, which is a critical component in the technology and renewable energy sectors. As a leading global copper producer, FCX is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing needs of AI companies, tech startups, and the broader electrification trend.

**1. Growing Demand for Copper**

A. Technology Sector and AI Boom

- **AI and Tech Startups**: The AI boom and the proliferation of tech startups are driving significant demand for copper. Copper is essential for the manufacturing of semiconductors, wiring, and other electronic components used in AI infrastructure and devices.
- **Data Centers**: The expansion of data centers, necessary to support AI workloads, further increases copper demand for electrical wiring and cooling systems.

B. Renewable Energy and Electrification

- **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The shift towards electric vehicles is a major copper demand driver. EVs use significantly more copper than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles due to their electric motors, batteries, and charging infrastructure.
- **Renewable Energy**: Copper is critical in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, as well as in the grid infrastructure required to distribute renewable energy.

**2. Strong Production Capabilities**

A. Diversified Asset Portfolio

- **Major Mines**: FCX operates some of the largest and most productive copper mines globally, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Morenci mine in Arizona. These assets provide a robust production base and economies of scale.
- **Geographic Diversity**: The company's mining operations span across multiple geographies, reducing risk and exposure to any single region.

B. Production Expansion Plans

- **Capacity Expansion**: FCX is actively investing in expanding its production capacity to meet rising copper demand. Projects like the Grasberg underground transition are set to significantly boost output.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and cost management are expected to enhance profitability and cash flow.

 **3. Favorable Market Conditions**

A. Copper Price Trends

- **Price Appreciation**: Copper prices have shown a strong upward trend driven by supply constraints and increasing demand. Analysts project continued price appreciation, benefiting major producers like FCX.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Investing in copper producers can serve as a hedge against inflation, as commodity prices often rise with inflationary pressures.

B. Supply Constraints

- **Limited New Supply**: The development of new copper mines is capital-intensive and time-consuming, leading to limited new supply coming online in the near term. This supply constraint supports higher copper prices.
- **Sustainable Practices**: FCX‚Äôs commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices positions it favorably with regulatory bodies and environmentally conscious investors.

**4. Financial Strength and Shareholder Value**

A. Strong Financial Position:

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: FCX has demonstrated strong revenue and profit growth, driven by high copper prices and efficient production.
- **Healthy Balance Sheet**: The company maintains a robust balance sheet with manageable debt levels, providing financial stability and flexibility.

B. Shareholder Returns

- **Dividends and Buybacks**: FCX has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Continued strong financial performance is likely to support ongoing shareholder returns.
- **Investment in Growth**: Strategic investments in expanding production and improving operational efficiency are expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.


**Conclusion**
Investing in Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) offers a strategic opportunity to gain exposure to the booming demand for copper driven by the AI revolution, technology advancements, and the global shift towards renewable energy. FCX‚Äôs strong production capabilities, favorable market conditions, financial strength, and commitment to shareholder value make it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth and stability in the commodities sector.


TLDR: booming AI/tech needs copper. These markets keep growing so more copper needed. FCX produces a lot of copper.

Added benefit it is also used a lot in the market of renewable energy which is also getting a lot of support. Getting in this business is also costly to set up so they kind of have a moat built up through that.

Walgreens,11,1dpz15h,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dpz15h/walgreens/,17,"Hey everyone,

I'm thinking about buying Walgreens (WBA) stock, but I'm not sure if it's a good move right now. Walgreens dropped by about 25% in a single day recently, and I'm curious about the reasons behind it and if it might be undervalued now.

Here's what I've found so far:
- The drop happened after Walgreens reported a 25% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings for Q3 2024. This was due to weaker consumer demand and some impairment charges from recent acquisitions
- some analysts think Walgreens is undervalued, estimating its fair value at around $24 per share, which is about 50% higher than its current price
- Walgreens has a high dividend yield of around 8.38%, which is great for dividend lovers like me. But they did cut their quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.25 per share recently 
- They're trying to stabilize revenue through cost-cutting and acquisitions, like Summit Health and Village MD, which seem promising
- There are also broader economic concerns like high oil prices and interest rates that could impact their performance 

So, given all this, do you think Walgreens is a good buy for a long-term, dividend-focused investor? Would love to hear your thoughts and any additional insights!

Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,4034,1dowoqn,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dowoqn/why_intel_is_the_most_undervalued_tech_stock/,1224,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom.

Ill just hold onto this in case i need it later![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)', 'If you like it at 30, you‚Äôll LOVE it at 20', 'I can comment on this one actually. I know semiconductors and the industry better than most but I‚Äôm no expert so YMMV etc. disclaimers. \n\nIntel is a very long way from using their ASML Deep EUV machine. Yes they got the first one. But now they have to develop the technology to use it. It‚Äôs new territory with all these new lithography machines. They don‚Äôt come ready to use out of the box. They are probably 2-5 years from having a process ready that uses it. \n\nFurther- you can‚Äôt just take your design and stick it in a new process node. You actually have to design the chip specifically for that node. Especially when you move manufacturers. The silicon made by intel and TSMC is actually quite different. So when they moved their manufacturing to TSMC they didn‚Äôt just take their design and hand it over. No, it was a massive investment to redesign the chips for the TSMC process. Things stay generally in the same place and the same superficial arrangement is there but at the gate level things look different. \n\nIntel has really faltered on execution lately. With their 10 nm process they really fell apart. In some ways they bit off more than they can chew. They tried to add 3 new really advanced techniques into the process that would have rocketed them ahead of TSMC had they worked. But they couldn‚Äôt get them to work for a few years. TSMC is much better at executing and delivering new processes. They go for small incremental improvements each year. \n\nIntel isn‚Äôt even manufacturing their newest generation themselves. That‚Äôs critical here. Most the semiconductor companies you talk about are either design houses or foundries or equipment makers. Intel did all three for years. So buying intel you are buying into all three industries. They fell apart on equipment and are buying outside equipment with ASMLs new machine. And they fell down on manufacturing with TSMC actually manufacturing the processor tiles for their new SKUs. \n\nAMD is a much smaller company and much more efficient. They design one chip well and then reuse it in all their parts with different packaging processes and their ‚Äúchiplet‚Äù designs. Intel makes dozens of different masks. And each one takes engineering time. \nAlso, AMD spun off their in house foundry as Global Foundries about 10 years ago. So they don‚Äôt have to worry about that. They design their silicon for TSMC‚Äôs process and rely on them to innovate and deliver. \n\nAll that said, I do think Intel is oversold. They still have massive market share in the consumer and server markets. They‚Äôre losing market share but we‚Äôre talking from 95% to 85%. They are pulling much lower margins though because the ferocious competition from AMD forces them to lower their prices. And honestly AMD has the better server and consumer CPU parts IMHO. Intel has much stronger relationships with the system integrators from years and years of partnership and shady business practices so that companies like Dell and Lenovo and server manufacturers like Super Micro all tend to use Intel processors. AMD has struggled in this regard. \n\nThe bigger story though is that AMD has a ton of room to grow by stealing market share. And Intel has little place to go but hold the line or lose more share. Those relationships are really strong though and it‚Äôs worth looking into the arrangements they have with the integrators. \n\nIntel has new management with a technical background instead of a sales background and that might help get the company back into the lead technologically but like getting a new head coach on a football team, it takes years to rebuild your bench and get the ball rolling on new research. Also the gains are getting harder and harder. The gates are only a few dozen atoms now. They aren‚Äôt really at this point getting smaller - they‚Äôre getting more dense which creates an ‚Äúequivalent shrinkage‚Äù. So 5 nm wasn‚Äôt 5nm feature size anymore it was a density as if the feature size was 5nm. So the power requirements aren‚Äôt going down like they should. But with the density increasing and the number of gates increasing and the amount of leakage in tiny gates means that power consumption and heat production are limiting factors. AMDs new cores are actually the same core. The efficiency cores are just smaller than the power cores. So the ‚Äúefficiency cores‚Äù just have to run slower because they are so dense and the heat gets built up. \n\nThere‚Äôs a lot to like with Intel but there are also very significant hurdles and many years of hard work to demonstrate that they can deliver - especially when it‚Äôs increasingly hard to make process node advancements. Exponential even.  If they deliver on backside power delivery first they might have a chance. Opening up the foundry might help. Especially with the US govt throwing money around for domestic production. But they won‚Äôt be making bleeding edge chips.

BYND is about to go BYND the moon.,0,1dqub5d,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dqub5d/bynd_is_about_to_go_bynd_the_moon/,29,"Remember when this stock ran up like 90 percent last earnings??? It wasn't because of the earnings... it was this.

Beyond Meat (BYND) is getting ATTACKED by shorts with a MASSIVE 39%+ short interest on its float. But guess what? On June 27th, BYND made its epic entrance onto the REGSHO INCLUSION LIST üöÄüí• and you know what that means... MOON TIME!

**What's regsho?** Glad you asked! According to Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ""threshold security"" means:
- Fails to deliver 10,000+ shares for 5 straight days
- Fails equal to at least 0.5% of total shares outstanding
- Security is listed by a self-regulatory organization (SRO)

Basically, it's a list of heavily shorted stocks that need to cover their butts! üòú When BYND is on regsho, shorting is like trying to wrestle a bear in a phone booth. Liquidity is tight and borrowing costs are THROUGH THE ROOF (IBKR‚Äôs retail fee is a whopping 111.7216%! ü§ë). Even the big boys are paying around 15-20%, which is INSANE.

Now, here‚Äôs the JUICY part: after 13 trading days (T+13) on regsho, forced covering kicks in. That means shorts have to start buying back shares, which can send the price SKYROCKETING. üöÄüìà

Check this out: On Feb 7th, BYND hit regsho and leading up to T+13, the stock‚Äôs price climbed and CLIMBED, until BOOM üí•üí• they covered their shorts and the price went nuts! Happened again on Apr 25th ‚Äì stock price up, up, and AWAY until the shorts HAD to cover, causing another HUGE pump. üí£üí•

Fast forward to NOW: BYND hit regsho on June 27th and history tells us this baby‚Äôs got some big moves coming. Sure, they might not pump exactly on T+13, but they gotta cover eventually. We've seen it take up to a month before, but the trend is clear: regsho = PRICE EXPLOSION! üí•üí∞

My positions? 8c July 19th, 9c July 19th, 10c Aug 16th, 12c Aug 16th. This is the regsho cash cow cycle, folks. Milk it responsibly ü•õ. 

**TLDR:** BYND is on regsho, and this usually leads to HUGE price jumps. Get ready for LIFTOFF! üöÄüöÄ

Need Advice/Feedback,6,1dq2o1o,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dq2o1o/need_advicefeedback/,13,"I started trading beginning of May 2023, just over a year now. I have a win rate over 65% but have lost over 7k. I just feel so defeated as I have not had a green month yet, feel like I am just getting worse. I mostly trade options, I like to use the Golden Zone for my entries. I can paper trade successfully with easy 20-30% gains, I take it to the real thing and lose it all. If I set my SL, the trade comes down hits my SL and goes right up past my TP. Whenever I don't set my SL it comes down and just keeps going down. If I avg down everything falls apart, If I don't avg down it seems to come back close to my entry, where if I did avg down would've been profitable. If I take the loss, it will just keep going past my entry. And yep you guessed it, If I don't take the loss maybe it keeps going, nope will turn around and die. I could sit here and say ""oh every time I do this the opposite happens blah blah"" but really its just my dumbass not staying patient or just being stupid and revenge trading. I have a couple trades each month that completely destroy my whole gains and eventually my port. I feel like If I keep going I am just going to eventually lose everything. I am just hoping someone else has been in this boat before and can give me some advice or just tell me the harsh reality that I can't do this, get out now. I deposit up around 1k at a time because I figure if I can work a small account I can work a bigger account, maybe just screwing myself. Half of these losses are from SPX, I am done with SPX until I have a bigger account.

Share buybacks? Another dividend raise? I don't fucking know - all I see is Jensen feasting on this joke of a spinach dip over the past week. Even the Wall Street regards are dropping price targets north of $170, couple at $200 already.

Jensen has said on multiple occasions now - GTC first, and the iNveStoR's meeting (regards) today - ""Blackwell will be the most successful product launch in NVDA's history"". The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. 

Then there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.

  
Anyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. 

Otherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures.

Stock: ACB (Aurora Cannabis, Canada)
price: $4.80

bidding on 1/17/25 $5.50 CALL is currently at $1.05.

Normally I would stay the fuck away from cannabis stocks because I believe market dynamics of legalization will continue bring prices and margins down significantly. However, this stock recently took a massive pummeling after an earning reports, and I would guess many investors share a more optimistic outlook than I do.

However, I felt like I couldn't ignore a 21% 7 month out of the money call. Hitting the strike price would be beautiful, I would pocket the premium plus a 14.5% gain on the underlying stock. lthe stock has another 20% to drop before i'm starting to see losses. i figure they won't fold completely in the next 7 months though and the hit it took was just coming down from a temporary up-swing. 

what do y'all think? I know this isn't big money, about the same as buying a pound of 30% THC cannabis at a massachusetts dispensary these days. i'm assuming the optimistic options pricing are hopeful leftovers from recent highs, definitely doesn't seem like something i would find in a high volume stock.",2024-06-27 15:08:11,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 12 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', 'Nobody tell him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Started options trading approximately five years ago. I was watching my Roth, personal brokerage account, and 401k from work slowly go up. I got bored. So fucking bored. That‚Äôs kind of why we are all here, right? That and to get rich or whatever. Anyway.  Ended up blowing a few options accounts (luckily didn‚Äôt touch the 401k or Roth). Made some good money along the way, but not enough. Always wanted MOAR. Still do. 

After seeing my options gains slowly dwindle, and realizing that I was being too impulsive, I slowed down.

If you have a regular job that brings in income and aren‚Äôt relying on trading for your day-to-day expenses, this approach to options might help you to NOT LOSE money. If you‚Äôre looking to get rich quick and you‚Äôre unemployed - probs not for you.  

1. Don‚Äôt put money in your options trading account unless it‚Äôs down to zero. You‚Äôll just end up with less money. There‚Äôs always a play, even with fifty bucks. 
2. Always withdraw when you can, and put it in your savings account. Play with house money. Unless you really want to full-time day trade, you don‚Äôt need that 25k in there. You might make more mistakes (I do, at least) when you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúup.‚Äù
3. If you float around the ~5 to 10k amount, only buy one or two options contracts at a time. You‚Äôll miss out on some huge gains, but you‚Äôll not have huge losses. And along the way, in my experience, you can net $500 + a week. It seems so small compared to the gain porn posts on here, but when you withdraw that shit - nah. 
4. When you DO want to make a big play - have all your day trades available. 
5. If you can, pull some of the amounts you transfer from your brokerage to your bank out in CASH. There is something about it that helps you to remember that, yes - it is REAL money. 
6. Don‚Äôt tell anyone about it. 
7. Enjoy the casino with less stress, and more money in day-to-day life.

Try to evaluate the investment objectively.\n\n-Do not buy random penny stocks  even if they have grown noticeably or someone says they know it will go up.\n\n-Only buy meme stocks like gamestop if you are confident and have a feel for the market. This is difficult to really explain but watch how a stock moves and you get an idea of resistance levels and when they are being broken and where to set your stop loss below resistance levels.\n\n-Do not mess with options unless you truly understand them and if you do, set a stop loss that is both conservative enough that you're not risking too much and liberal enough that the stock's typical volatility doesn't trigger it. This also applies to holding stock but on a longer term scale.\n\n-Try not to focus too much on the market and missed opportunities.

Are we approaching the end of supermarkets due to increased shrink? And is Costco membership model the way of the future?,1,1dpyak0,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dpyak0/are_we_approaching_the_end_of_supermarkets_due_to/,18,"With Walgreens $WBA preparing to shut down hundreds more of their underperforming stores in the US. I wanted to look at shrink levels of Costco.  


One of the first articles I came by from last month lays it out pretty good so I'll just copy some of the data from there. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-costco-limits-retail-theft-checks-reciepts-2023-5


>Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, and other major retailers have warned of rising theft rates plaguing stores across the US.

>But one company appears to be immune to the problem: Costco.

>The warehouse chain's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said Thursday that **shrinkage ‚Äî or inventory losses due to theft, fraud, or other causes ‚Äî was largely unchanged.**

> Galanti said the company saw a slight increase after the rollout of self-checkout three years ago, but those rates have since reverted to the longer-term trend.

> *T*arget**, meanwhile, has said its losses from shrinkage will balloon to more than **$1 billion in 2023, up $500 million over last year.** Walmart's CEO said in December that stores would close if theft didn't slow. Dollar Tree said this week that it was considering locking up more goods in stores as it faces rising shrink.

>Overall, theft helps drive about **$95 billion in losses every year for US retailers,** according to estimates by the National Retail Federation, an industry group.



Costco has personal information on every customer that goes through their door. Their products are in bulky large packages. and so on... 

Gist of the matter is that lack of shrinkage these days is a huge competitive advantage which directly translates to increased profits. The more competition's stores close the more shoppers Costco gets. They can reduce prices more if they need to or keep selling it at the same price as their competition. It looks like they've cornered the market for the time being. 

Obviously dollar stores are leeches that prey on small towns in the US and they are unlikely to be affected by this. But how can Walmart for example keep growing or even prevent loss of revenue over the next few years until perhaps this theft trend changes. 


Another player in this category is BJ's Wholesale Club. With larger potential for growth and a much lower PE ratio (less than half) I believe a combination of these two stocks will be guaranteed winners in the next few years.

(NYSE: CHWY) (‚ÄúChewy‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today that it has agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 17,550,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price per share of $28.49, which represents a 5.0% discount to yesterday‚Äôs closing price, resulting in an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $500 million (the ‚ÄúRepurchase‚Äù) from Buddy Chester Sub LLC, which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (‚ÄúBC Partners‚Äù), Chewy‚Äôs largest shareholder. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Repurchase.

Chewy believes today‚Äôs Repurchase is an accretive use of capital and provides an efficient mechanism to repurchase shares at a discount to the current market price, while further reducing the ownership position of the Company‚Äôs largest shareholder. Chewy‚Äôs increasing profitability and free cash flow generation enables the Company to further optimize its capital allocation strategy through this transaction, which comes in addition to the recently announced $500 million share repurchase program. This transaction together with the Company‚Äôs share repurchase program underscores the confidence Chewy has in the business and its compelling growth and margin expansion strategy. In light of Chewy‚Äôs expanding free cash flow generation, the Company will continue to assess options to opportunistically return cash to its shareholders.

The future can‚Äôt be delayed and is inevitable, You made it.
I see you are well off. I see mom and dad are taken care of. You are off the bus, driving a Black Benz. You are not working overtime mopping floors and cleaning toilets just to barely afford to rent someone‚Äôs basement.

The Universe never lied about a vision of a hungry man. You were a hungry young man in this vast universe but now, now the universe is within you. Remember this.

That‚Äôs what I gave you. I‚Äôve set a chain of events in motion that got you here. 
Sorry to put you through the up and downs and the coarse nature of the path I set you on, but that‚Äôs the only way to reach the top - risk falling off the cliff. Bet you learned some shit. You‚Äôre welcome.
Just remember, you were here in somebody‚Äôs basement . You couldn‚Äôt afford school. You were in a foreign land, you‚Äôve made it your home,a fish out of water, you haven‚Äôt seen your family in over a decade and counting. When you were serving at a restaurant, rich Highschool classmates acted like they don‚Äôt know you and left you $1 tip, you swallowed your tears as you wiped their table after they left. You couldn‚Äôt afford medicine for your mother. You were hungry. You cried to sleep, woke up in the morning to do a 15 hour shift. Women ignored you, old ‚Äúfriends‚Äù disrespected you when they saw you at the bus stop. You were lonely, your birthdays never existed, nobody made a toast to your health. Nobody invited you to Christmas, Thanksgiving or to parties. Don‚Äôt forget you wiped your tears off your phone screen as you typed this. 

But now you‚Äôre here. You‚Äôve made it. I trust you‚Äôve found a good woman and a great network of people who care about you and your purpose.
Now that you‚Äôre living in affluence,I hope greed didn‚Äôt consume your battered soul. Don‚Äôt forget to help others. All the opulence is vain if you are not sharing it.

Grindr CEO George Arison has outlined plans for the location-based app will launch a new feature called ""Roam"" allowing users to temporarily place their profile in a new location ahead of a trip, in order to plan that trip.

* He also wants Grindr to connect its users to services, from restaurants to [fitness and health professionals](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion), offered with a ""Grindr seal of approval.""
* ""Do you want to find a LGBTQ-friendly GP or therapist? Grindr will do that for you,"" Arison said.
* Users will also gain more options to differentiate their profiles: Someone looking for friends in a new city won't have to wade through everyone using the app for casual sex.
* The changes are being tested now in several markets and Grindr expects to launch them fully later this year.

Users have been ""hacking"" the app by inventing new uses for it --- from sourcing travel tips to monkeypox vaccines ---even though the app infrastructure itself barely changed.

* ""We're working to meet our users where they are,"" Arison said, ""We had not added any enhanced features for a number of years.""

Grindr currently around 14 million monthly active users worldwide, and a market capitalization of around $2 billion.

* Arison also said Grindr's growth markets are Latin America and Asia, but added ""In the US, almost 30% of Gen Z adults identify as queer. All of these people will need a tool for connecting with others.""

On AI:

* ""AI will fundamentally change how dating will be done, creating better ways of making connections --- and our users will decide exactly how,"" he said.
* ""We need to lead them there, through the opportunity to participate in piloting features, and giving users a clear choice of whether they want to use this technology.""

Carvana is getting squeezed,0,1dq1tvz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dq1tvz/carvana_is_getting_squeezed/,18,"A lot of people were convinced, and are still convinced (including myself), that Carvana is a dogshit business that is overvalued and that the stock will eventually crash. There has been convincing short seller research publicized with the short sellers taking hefty positions in Carvana at much lower prices compared to where Carvana is now. Everyone has been expecting Carvana to crash back down by now but it hasn't. You see, short positions have inherent risks that long positions don't have and the risks have to be actively managed. The market has been very strong recently and short sellers as an aggregate have been suffering. Based on recent price action, it seems like short sellers are reaching capitulation and are decreasing their short positions or entirely closing them out. I think Carvana is seeing unusually strong price action because short sellers are capitulating and closing out their shorts, resulting in higher and higher prices. 

I don't have a position in Carvana yet. I don't blindly short stocks without a catalyst in mind or some other way that I can determine if I'm right or wrong. If the market continues to be very strong, Carvana might continue to squeeze further. It's heavily shorted with the shorts being significantly underwater. One thing that should kill the squeeze is massive dilution, which should happen at some point. The family that controls Carvana is also pretty shady and I wouldn't put it past them to orchestrate a squeeze, sell their own shares, and then issue massive dilution after. It's worth watching this stock right now because a materially good news release can result in further short covering, while a dilution news event should cause a prolonged stock drop. I doubt that the market would absorb a couple billion dollars of a stock offering at current prices.",2024-06-27 20:51:51,"['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 287 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15hrhj1/quality_cvna_dd/) \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)', ""You don't even know what a short squeeze is, do you?"", 'ffs... side, strike, expiry, or ban', 'I went short today! ü´°', '![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)', 'Pretty sure they use DriveTime to hide things.', 'https://preview.redd.it/ke9qtm5ih79d1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea4cb1b23afb74e94ba4d4fa54786e18b8a36143\n\nBeen going well for me', 'I remember looking at it when it was $12 and thinking that was too high.  üòÖ', 'Danny Devito giving you a hug.', ""I'll never financially recover from shorting CVNA.

Don't miss out on $GRND, a future 10 bagger",21,1doz8ap,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1doz8ap/grindr_hosts_first_investor_day_dont_miss_out_on/,33,"[Investor Day Deck](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_presentation/2024/06/Grindr-Investor-Day-6-26-2024.pdf)

Grindr is hosting today in New York its inaugural investor day as a public company, unveiling its plans to deliver on its mission to build the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket. Presentations by Grindr senior management will highlight its industry-leading performance and user engagement metrics, the Company‚Äôs new product roadmap that is powered by AI, and a four-year financial outlook.

‚ÄúGrindr is unique because it was built by gay people for gay people. By focusing on our users over the past 15 years, we‚Äôve achieved tremendous loyalty and engagement from them,‚Äù said George Arison, Grindr‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. ‚ÄúThroughout our investor day, we will articulate the innovation we are planning in order to make our user experience even better and drive long-term growth. We are improving connection and casual dating, which have always been core to Grindr, through a suite of features called Right Now, while also creating new AI-first features to help users more easily find long-term relationships. We know our users want additional functionality to help them better access other types of social connections and to access curated, relevant information and services that will enhance the quality of their lives. Through new product expansions, we are creating ways for users to gain these experiences in the app.‚Äù

Grindr will present a multi-year product plan to build out additional functionality in its app. This includes developing eight new products for users to engage with Grindr‚Äôs core use cases of connectivity, dating, and relationships, and Gayborhood expansion use cases, which are new partnership-based digital services typically found in physical gayborhoods. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap leverages AI in a variety of ways, including the Grindr Wingman product.

Today, Grindr is increasing its revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 of at least 40% remains intact. Looking out to 2027, with the Company‚Äôs new product plans designed to support the core dating business, Grindr expects to deliver 20-25% revenue growth annually through 2027, with Adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 39-42%. Grindr‚Äôs expanded, partnership-based, digital Gayborhood services, including travel, wellness, and entertainment experiences, are not reflected in Grindr‚Äôs revenue outlook through 2027, though modest investments in these initiatives are factored into the company‚Äôs long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins.

‚ÄúGrindr has built a durable financial model that is delivering strong, reliable growth as we execute on our monetization strategy,‚Äù said Vanna Krantz, Chief Financial Officer. ‚ÄúOur 2024 revenue guidance increase combined with the longer-term financial targets we are announcing today demonstrate our confidence in Grindr‚Äôs continued strong revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability even as we invest prudently in our product roadmap and new use cases.

"GDEV: high-growth creator of Hero Wars & PixelGun3D with an overweight $5 PT
",9,1dp73qj,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dp73qj/gdev_highgrowth_creator_of_hero_wars_pixelgun3d/,15,"Here is some research I've gathered and compiled on the video game company GDEV/GDEVW and would like to share. Your feedback & commentary are most appreciated.

Disclosure: I‚Äôm long with 20 000 shares.

**TL;DR**

GDEV is one of the largest pure-play free-to-play (F2P) mobile and PC video game companies by bookings. It has a portfolio of large genre-leading franchises such as MMoRPG Hero Wars, FPS Pixel Gun 3D and puzzle game Island Hopper which position it well in a market that increasingly favours large brands and scale. Organic bookings and sales growth accelerated to +4% and +10%, respectively, in Q1 ‚Äò24 and Q4 ‚Äò23 representing the fastest growth of any peers.¬†

Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency with platform commission expense decreasing to a historically low level of 21.9%.¬† Share of the PC market has increased to 38% with 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year on all platforms.

Company is trading at a ridiculously cheap bargain price of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with high insider ownership.

**Cliff notes**

GDEV has three key franchises, under which it has several titles:

Hero Wars: Alliance (mobile, Hero wars: Dominion Era (PC), Island Hoppers (mobile and PC), Pixel Gun 3D (mobile and PC). GDEV has several games in development set to launch from late 2024 onwards. All franchises continue to deliver growth.¬†

With several growth levers at its disposal, Cantor expects GDEV to deliver mid to high single digit organic growth in 2024-2025, with potential for 10% growth, positioning GDEV with one of the highest organic growth outlooks in the peer group. As GDEV invests for growth, we believe their margins (2% EBITDA and 4% FCF in 2024) to climb to 20%-30% in the medium term. GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales versus peers on 1.5x, 4x EV/EBITDA versus peers 12x (ROVIO was bought by SEGA at 20x EV/EBITDA in 2023), with 40% of its equity value in balance sheet cash ($174m).

Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated coverage of GDEV with an outperform rating and a minimum $5 price target. They highlight that GDEV returned to positive organic bookings and revenue growth in Q4 2023 and will continue to deliver consistent positive mid to high single digit organic growth through 2024-2025 driven by robust user acquisition spending, a growing active and paying user base in existing titles and new game launches.¬†

Last but not least, GDEV has taken advantage of the market rout of 2023 and undergone a buy-back offer at 2$ to purchase undervalued shares which reduced its float by 17 million shares.

[FY2023 summary](https://preview.redd.it/0khj6uk4vy8d1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=a34536ad8e4799ecbf744a9c2053b02846d2031a)

**Investment Thesis**

* Mobile and PC free-to-play market has stabilized after two years of declines, with growth resuming in late 2023 and Q1 24, and continuing into Q2 24.
* GDEV‚Äôs portfolio of genre-leading franchises, large user base and leading UA expertise leave it well positioned in a market that continues to favour large, established brands and scale publishers.
* Organic bookings growth accelerated to +4% in Q1 24. With several growth levers, organic growth is expected to accelerate to even 10% by FY 24-25.
* EBITDA margins will remain in the high single digit in FY 24-25 due to the investment, but long-term margins should reach 20%-30% offering material long-term profit upside
* With 40% of its market cap in cash, GDEV trades on a 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) and has balance sheet optionality.
* The company is trading at around 4x EV/adj. EBITDA, which is way below peer valuations. It also generates decent cash flows from operations with a price target of at least 5$, an upside of 100%.

[Cash Generating Capabilities](https://imgur.com/afbS2KC)

**History**

The company has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings in 2010, which is when its founders first met. At the start of that decade, Fadeev was running a social games development studio, Progrestar, while Boris Gertsovskiy was putting the finishing touches to his plan to start a game business.

Within four years, Nexters was born and the company grew rapidly, particularly following the launch of its blockbuster title ‚Äî Hero Wars ‚Äî that first brought it international acclaim. However, it was the strategic decision of 2018 to scale on mobile that really powered the firm to the next level. Since then, Nexters has vastly increased its player base, revenue and team to total over 700 professionals, the bulk of them located in Cyprus.

>

GDEV is currently rated as one of the top-3 developers in Europe with¬†**400+ millions**¬†total game installs worldwide with hit games like Hero Wars, Pixel Gun 3D, Island Hopper and others.

[Marketing Growth Figures](https://imgur.com/mv8sJM4)

**What is Hero-Wars?**

The game follows a formula that many mobile gamers will be familiar with: it‚Äôs all about building up a team of heroes and watching them make their way through dungeons. If they‚Äôre not up to the challenge, you have to grind and enhance them, or you have to work to unlock other heroes who might be better suited to the challenge. It‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs really easy to get sucked into, filled with daily challenges that start easy and slowly become more and more difficult as you play and those who play it will soon find that it has become a part of their daily routine.

Throughout the year, Nexters has been actively engaged in its Hero Wars franchise. For example, they have divided Hero Wars into two games ‚Äî the mobile Hero Wars Alliance and the browser-based Hero Wars Dominion Era. Recently they got a collaboration with Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider and have introduced Lara Croft as a character.

The company has released Hero Wars comic books and animated shorts like Rovio did with its Angry Birds franchise. Mobile games outlet Pocket Tactics included Hero Wars Alliance in selection of the best games in 2023 & 2024 and colleagues from PCGames included Hero Wars Dominion Era in selection of the 19 best browser games of the year!

**PIXEL GUN 3D on PC: The new Blockbuster**

[PixelGun3D](https://imgur.com/9sWytbj)

The PC version of Pixel Gun 3D was released on STEAM on April 2nd and it was one of the platform‚Äôs strongest game releases in a while. PG3D broke into the TOP-20 successful new releases on Steam and took first place among the best free-to-play games of April by the total number of players! It recouped all of its development costs within the first day, an unheard feat:¬†

* The game was launched on Steam April 2, entering on debut the Top 20 most sold and Top 50 most played games.
* The mobile version has already accumulated over $200 million in cumulative all-time bookings, while the PC version is just beginning its journey.
* The peak concurrent Steam users count reached 25,000 players on the first day of release.
* The Steam version of Pixel Gun 3D recouped its PC platform development costs within the first day of release, making 5 times the average daily in-app purchases of the mobile version.
* The results were achieved without significant marketing investments, capitalizing on strong brand awareness across the globe.
* 24k reviews on Steam estimating about 630k to 1.20m owners as of may 14th¬†
* The average session duration for Pixel Gun 3D on PC is an impressive 70 minutes per day, which is 3.5 times longer than on mobile devices!
* The retention rate on the first day is 30% higher than in the mobile version. What a result!

**Island Hopper and Block City Wars are upcoming blockbusters**

Highlights of Island Hopper:

* The game has made $47 million in revenue
* Over 20 million downloads to date
* Top 10 Farming Category free games (according to AppMagic data)
* Soft launched in 2021 with a global release late in 2023

There‚Äôs so much to do in this adventure game that features Emily, a distraught sister who sailed all the way to a mysterious island in search of her brother. Besides cultivating crops, you can take part in several minigames, go on thrilling camping trips, look for hidden treasures, and even try to uncover secrets of the island‚Äôs past. You will never run short of activities in Island Hoppers.

What is Block City Wars?¬†

It‚Äôs a reboot of the game Block City, originally released in 2016, a GTA-style open-world shooter in minecraft style for mobile platforms. This year, GDEV decided to completely overhaul the game, using all the experience gained from Pixel Gun 3D to turn Block City Wars into a world-class game. Combining a brand new approach to game design with familiar elements that made the original game popular, Block City Wars has made it into the top 10 best Roblox-like games according to PocketGamer!

[Block City Wars](https://imgur.com/evlbJEh)

First quarter 2024 highlights

* Revenue of $107 million decreased by 10% year-over-year.
* Bookings of $109 million increased by 4% year-over-year.
* Second consecutive quarter of bookings growth.¬†
* Loss for the period of $1 million in Q1 2024 vs. loss of $8 million in Q1 2023.
* ¬†$129 million of available cash funds.
* Record high audience expansion due to marketing efficiency
* Share of PC platform increased to 38%
* Blended platform commission expense decreased to a historically low level of 21.9%
* 14 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) +17% year-over-year
* ¬†Adjusted EBITDA of negative $3 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to negative $12 million in the first quarter of 2023.

>

GDEV continues to fire on all cylinders. Q1 2024 represents the second quarter of impressive bookings growth, the main metric to follow.¬† Lots of people still think that revenue is the most important metric in any business. for online service, the most important is bookings.¬†

For example you purchase an annual Microsoft Office subscription in a midyear. Microsoft includes half of this subscription payment as the revenue for this year and second half for the next year, but as a booking this payment will be reflected as a full cash inflow to the account.

In mobile/online games revenue is based on the distance the player stays in the game, that's why cash inflows or bookings are more relevant to assess the company as it's not tied with time and shows the real figures.

[Operating Highlights](https://imgur.com/6fim6Hk)

It's important to know that EBITDA is generally designed to show¬† the real profit of a company. By default, high EBITDA margins mean that a business can generate a lot of income from the revenue it makes, but in a free-to-play (F2P) model of the gaming industry there are several interesting nuances.¬†

1. Revenue: If a generous player pays say $1000 in a game today, you cannot recognize this money as revenue immediately, it has to be recognized gradually.¬†
2. Marketing Costs: for gaming companies marketing expenses are not just costs but investments. if a company sees an opportunity to invest more money in marketing today, it ensures revenue streams for long periods ahead, therefore significant marketing expenditures are good.¬†

A quite successful mobile gaming company may see¬† great potential in investing money in marketing, but revenue is recognized gradually while expenses are recognized immediately. As a result EBITDA is in the negative, but the company is in a positive position.

**Total addressable market**

Cantor expects the global video game market revenue growth to reaccelerate in 2025 onwards to mid-single-digit growth, with 2024 being a year of stabilisation as companies focus on restructuring their cost base after years of over-investments. They see 2025 as a stronger year in terms of new large AAA releases including GrandTheftAuto VI and new hardware launches. mobile seems to be nearing a bottom, with market data and quarterly reports from listed companies looking more positive and suggesting that market growth is resuming in 2024 before improving in 2025.

The 2% decline in the mobile games market in 2023 is an improvement from the 5% decline in 2022. encouragingly, the US was flat in 2023 and 65% of the top 20 markets were flat to very modestly up in the year, prepping for a more bullish set-up in 2025.

According to Sensor Tower‚Äôs Q1 2024 Digital Market Index, quarterly mobile game spend surpassed $20 billion for the first time in two years ‚Äî it reached $20.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year. Player spending on iOS grew nearly 6% year-over-year to $13 billion, while consumer spend on Google Play slightly declined to $7.3 billion (-1.3%).

**Concluding remarks**

GDEV is a great company with solid financials and a bright future trading at ridiculously cheap bargain prices of 2$ at a valuation of 4x EV/EBITDA (peers 12x) and 0.5x EV/Sales (peers 1.5x) with insiders having skin in the game.

Rivian is up 6% today off of an analyst upgrading to an $18 price target. Their investor day is this Thursday, which will likely see more analyst upgrades and possibly some big announcements on their partnership with NVIDIA.

Crucially, their stock spiked to over $25 last year in the week following their investor day when the stock was in a similar spot - beaten down to near all-time lows by negative sentiment that hadn‚Äôt yet caught up to positive indicators.

""The ACIP develops recommendations for U.S. immunizations, including ages when vaccines should be given, number of doses, time between doses, and precautions and contraindications.""

This is the first ACIP meeting since H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in cows. The meeting agenda is typical for this time of the year, except it includes an update on H5N1 avian influenza.

Finland as the first country worldwide will start to vaccinate high risk groups like fur farm workers against H5N1 next week with vaccines from CSL. This is a response to outbreaks on at least 70 fur farms. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/finland-start-bird-flu-vaccinations-humans-2024-06-25)

As part of a recent agreement between 15 European Union member states, HERA, and CSL, Ireland will receive vaccine doses for high risk groups this year. [Source](https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/ireland-to-receive-vaccines-for-people-at-higher-risk-of-bird-flu/)

H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in more than 100 dairy cattle herds and the H5N1 risk for dairy farm workers is elevated. Three infected farm workers have been identified and more cases are suspected. [Source](https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/bird-flu-outbreak-avian-flu-containment-h5n1-eradication-in-cattle/)

In May the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has ordered 4.8 million vaccine doses for humans in the USA against the H5N1 strain circulating in cows, which CSL will deliver this summer.

""Moderna and Pfizer are each in the process of competing for federal contracts to build a national stockpile of mRNA vaccines targeted toward the new bird flu amid mounting concerns it may be spreading among humans."" [Source](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/3022322/moderna-pfizer-competing-hhs-bid-mrna-vaccines-bird-flu/)

Last time H5N1 avian influenza significantly influenced several stocks, it looked like this:

""In response to the reports, shares of Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax NVAX, CureVac CVAC and BioNTech rose 13.7%, 3.6%, 5.3%, 18.8% and 11.1%, respectively, on Wednesday.""

""CureVac N.V. shares (CVAC) were up 25% Wednesday, while Moderna Inc. stock (MRNA) gained 14% and BioNTech SE's American depositary receipts (BNTX) were up more than 10%.""

Will ACIP recommend vaccinating dairy farm workers and other high risk groups and influence the stock market?

"Taking a closer look at the Rivian, Volkswagon partnership",6,1dp4z0m,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dp4z0m/taking_a_closer_look_at_the_rivian_volkswagon/,8,"Rivian Automotive (RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY) have announced a significant joint venture that includes a substantial investment by Volkswagen in Rivian. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of software and electrical architecture for both companies, combining their strengths to lower costs per vehicle and enhance innovation on a global scale. Rivian's advanced zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will form the foundation for this collaboration, which will benefit both automakers as they develop new vehicle models in the latter half of the decade.

Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian by 2026, starting with an initial $1 billion through an unsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian‚Äôs common stock under certain conditions. This investment will help alleviate concerns about Rivian's financial stability, particularly given the company's recent losses and workforce reductions. The partnership will enable Volkswagen to leverage Rivian‚Äôs existing electrical architecture and software platform in the short term, while both companies aim to roll out vehicles utilizing the joint technology in the future.

First and foremost, the investment bolsters Rivian's liquidity, providing a lifeline to the startup as it navigates the challenges of scaling up production. The $7.858 billion in cash, augmented by Volkswagen's infusion, transforms the company's financial position, ensuring a solid foundation for the development of its R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. By addressing short-term concerns, the joint venture paves the way for a more sustainable growth trajectory.The strategic benefits extend beyond capital. Rivian's cutting-edge technology, particularly its zonal hardware design and electrical architecture, becomes a valuable asset for Volkswagen. This integration accelerates both companies' software development, enabling them to create more efficient and cost-effective EV solutions. 

As a result, the partnership fosters a competitive edge, with both entities set to disrupt the mid-to-high-end segment of the market.The deal also implies a shift in market dynamics, as the collaboration signals a shift from standalone competition to a more cooperative model. Smaller EV manufacturers may feel the pressure to either enhance their own technology or explore similar strategic alliances to maintain their relevance. Legacy automakers like Volkswagen, now armed with Rivian's technology, are no longer spectators in the race for electric dominance.However, while the partnership is a game-changer, it's crucial to note that it doesn't guarantee an immediate turnaround for Rivian. The company must still execute effectively on its production optimization and cost structure improvements, as evidenced by the retooling efforts and efficiency initiatives mentioned. The future profitability of both parties will hinge on the successful integration and the ability to deliver on the promises of the joint venture.

Market reaction to the deal has been notably positive for Rivian, with its stock surging up to 50% in after-hours trading. Analysts have hailed the partnership as a game-changer, with Wedbush Securities raising its price target for Rivian's stock and highlighting the significant boost to Rivian's financial health and future prospects. Conversely, Volkswagen's stock saw a slight dip due to concerns over the size of the investment and its struggling software subsidiary Cariad.

The DEA's comment period will end on July 22, 2024 essentially making rescheduling a sure thing. The reason rescheduling is so relevant to the business end of the marijuana industry is it will allow businesses involved with marijuana to write off expenses and claim deductions on their operating costs like ordinary businesses. Pot stocks have been beaten down for years and are due for a major run. I see this as well as several other major catalysts coming up that could send MSOX into double digits. Tell me how I‚Äôm wrong or why you think I should bail on my position.

Some of the penny weed stocks are probably a good bargain, but it's tough to gauge whether legislation finally passes; it may have the best chance it's had in 2024, though that may not be saying much. most of these stocks aren't really going to pop until you see the likes of Phillip Morris introducing cannabis cigarettes, but a lot still has to happen to get there.

The catalysts they are talking about are what I found - they are burning cash for CAPEX, but if they survive until 2026 they can do well.

Tesla isn't the only company that can survive in the space - Rivian demand is growing and they make a great vehicle. They have a strong offering so far, and with enough cash to survive, the R2 will do well and continue further growth into the R3.

Rivian's new partnership and investment with VW was inevitable, though it was uncertain which brand would partner with them. 

We are still low, and this may still be a great time to add some.

Bullish, regards.

The main quarrel with paypal is a sad argument about competitors (SQ 55M users) when paypal is clearly top dawg.

PYPL also has access to tons of important never before seen ad data about consumer purchases which once they start to sell will propel them ever more. Currently Paypal stock price sits at a measly $57 compared to its ATH of $308. If you buy a share of paypal now it is the same as getting one in 2017.

2017 Revenue: 13bil

2024 Revenue 30bil

Its only a matter of time before pypl stock wakes up again and you have missed the train. analysts put a $75 price target for paypal but they cant predict the future, My price target? 120+ thats an easy 12m 1Bagger with leap contracts that can easily have 10bagger potential.

As most people know, taking a loan and gambling with it is super risky. 
That's why I thought this would be the best place to get some ideas of how you could take advantage of it. 


I was looking for ideas on how to capitalize on this.
If I got a loan of 18k to pay over 18 months (minimum duration) you could invest it all on companies that pay higher dividends than the fees and use your wage to pay the monthly fee of around 1050‚Ç¨. (Around 6.3%)

That would both pay for your loan and give you roughly a 4% skim. \n\nHistorically, there's about a 10% to 15% chance that your bond would default within 12 months. That would end your remaining interest payments, and you probably wouldn't get more than half of your principle back. So then you'd be screwed on your loan. It's literally financial Russian roulette. The probability of default is pretty close to the odds that a revolver would give you.\n\nYou could also buy a diversified turbo-junk bond fund with high yield, so you are not just exposed to one company, but the ones I looked up had yields of like 12% after management fees.

Grindr's (GRND) investor day tomorrow could introduce some new catalysts,163,1do9bus,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1do9bus/grindrs_grnd_investor_day_tomorrow_could/,88,"Alright degenerates,

Been balls deep in GRND research lately, and I'm starting to think we're sleeping on a rainbow gold mine here.

Grindr's investor day is tomorrow, and these guys are talking about building a wholeass ""global gayborhood"" in your pocket. We're not just talking dick pics and ""I'm horny"" messages here - this could be the Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for the LGBTQIA++. Most recently they're expanding into travel because apparently gays travel a lot.

George Arison is a Gigachad baller CEO. I watched his interviews. He's a human catalyst for getting shit done.

[gay bear CEO](https://preview.redd.it/7gn0yj5qkq8d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=82463c096e386577fe0ec126d9a0e2a59199ae03)

He's been teasing AI and machine learning shit they've been testing, which sounds like it could print money if they get it right. We all know gays love to roleplay and pretend, so lots of potential in this Gay-AI. Even if their AI-wingman feature is just some horny twink bot, it's a revenue stream waiting to happen...

Another thing is that they're only monetizing 7% of their users right now. SEVEN PERCENT. That's like leaving money on the table. They recently tried changing their pricing model to offer weekly subs and bam... 16% increase in revenue per paying user.

How are people not more bullish on RDDT?,33,1dok3ph,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dok3ph/how_are_people_not_more_bullish_on_rddt/,60,"Look, I know it's hip to be contrarian and dunk on this platform around here but let's think with the correct head.

Reddit has 1/3 the market cap of Snap and Pinterest. Sure those companies are more mature and have much larger revenues but Reddit is soooo much a better investment. First, Reddit has no competition. Snap or Pinterest can easily get their lunch eaten by Tiktok or whatever next trendy app comes along. Meanwhile even the true regards over at r/RedditAlternatives have thrown in the towel and admit there's no alternative to Reddit. Of course reddit is never gonna compete with Insta or Tiktok due to low quality userbase (yeah I'm talking about you) and a medium less conducive to advertising. But it doesn't matter! Reddit only need to be 1/20th of meta for us to get rich.

Reddit is only gonna keep growing like the chode your wife loves so much. They got Google sending them giga traffic because of all the BS AI articles trying to game the search system. They got OpenAI about to start referencing reddit in their results. They got AI translation for their entire content to other languages for international expansion in testing.

Best part is how bad the current advertising on Reddit is. Some people say this is a negative but it's not, that's what makes this such an opportunity. I've seen how dog water Reddit ads were targeted a few years ago. Now it's merely bad. You're telling me they can't at least make it decent after a while? When communities are already separated by topic?

Half the analysts I see talk about Reddit on TV have no idea what's going on or what the site is other than it's an old school forum that's bad at selling ads. This screams opportunity, 5x is much more likely than 50%.

Tldr more users more revenue per user ready for blastoff to Uranus
